The US Department of 9 Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued dozens of guidance documents. The US FDA has 10 taken a significant step by releasing its first comprehensive draft guidance on AI-driven regulatory 11 decision-making. Jan 23, 2025 \u00b7 The draft guidance acknowledges that the use of AI in the drug product life cycle is broad and rapidly evolving, and strongly encourages sponsors and other interested parties to engage early with FDA to discuss their specific AI model development and use plans. Aug 30, 2024 \u00b7 In this article, we endeavour to summarise the wide-ranging whitepaper, which, over the course of 33 pages, sets out the FDA \u2019s aim to understand the use of AI and ML in drug development . What is FDA guidance on artificial intelligence? The FDA issued draft guidance to provide recommendations on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) intended to support a regulatory decision about a drug or biological product\u2019s safety, effectiveness or quality. Can artificial intelligence support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently published its long-awaited draft guidance on considerations for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics, which provides a comprehensive, risk-based framework to help sponsors evaluate and manage AI models. How can Ai be used in drug development & regulatory evaluation? A key aspect to the appropriate application of AI modeling in drug development and regulatory evaluation is ensuring model credibility \u2014trust in the performance of an AI model for a particular context of use. Context of use is defined as how an AI model is used to address a certain question of interest. How can FDA Guidance help drug development? The guidance can 275 help drug development's changing landscape by addressing advanced methodology inte- 276 gration, interoperability, and RWE framework alignment gaps. 277 The FDA \u2019s draft guidance is a significant step in integrating AI and RWE into regu- 278 latory decision-making. Jan 17, 2025 \u00b7 On January 6, 2025, the US FDA released a highly anticipated guidance on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug development .

The test involves a human evaluator who interacts with both a machine and a human through text-based communication. If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish the machine from the human, the machine is considered to have demonstrated intelligent behavior equivalent to that of a human [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test), [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/).\n\nTuring's original paper can be accessed in various formats, including a PDF version [here](https://phil415.pbworks.com/f/TuringComputing.pdf).\n\nRegarding the use of the Turing Test in modern LLM evaluation benchmarks, the test is often referenced as a foundational concept for assessing machine intelligence. However, it is not typically used as a direct benchmark in LLM evaluations today. Instead, LLMs are evaluated using a variety of benchmarks that test specific capabilities such as natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation [Evidently AI](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks), [Turing](https://www.turing.com/resources/understanding-llm-evaluation-and-benchmarks).\n\nIn summary, while the Turing Test is a seminal concept in AI, modern LLM evaluations use more specific and varied benchmarks to assess different aspects of language model performance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765800219, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_83554c687e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 324, "prompt_tokens": 6852, "total_tokens": 7176, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 6852, "completion_tokens": 324, "agent_id": null}

First, we will make a short remark regarding the data preprocessing step, that will be useful when explaining the What is a transformer in a neural network? The transformer is a neural network component that can be used to learn useful representations of sequences or sets of data-points. The transformer has driven recent advances in natural language processing, computer vision, and spatio-temporal modelling. What is a transformer in NLP? ling of the learned dependencies.Convolutional neural networks model the local context and many layers are required to del the long-term dependencies. Nowadays, transformers are used in various NLP tasks (text generation, text summarization, question answering, entailment, machine translation, etc.) and are also becoming more popular in f el Why is linearity a problem in a transformer? linearity in the representations. The transformer \u2019s encoder and decoder are composed of multiple complex layers, this indicating that the vanising gra ient problem is likely to appear. Residual connections solve this problem, by connecting lower layers to higher layers such that the gradients are allowed to flo Transformer architectures consume the lionshare of computational budgets associated with today\u2019s most powerful language and vision models, making research into greater computational efficiency a hot and essential direction.

General overviewThe classic architecture of a transformer consists of an encoder , represented by a stack of N encoder blocks/layers, and a decoder, represented by a ack of N decoder blocks/layers. First, we will make a short remark regarding the data preprocessing step, that will be useful when explaining the What is a transformer in a neural network? The transformer is a neural network component that can be used to learn useful representations of sequences or sets of data-points. The transformer has driven recent advances in natural language processing, computer vision, and spatio-temporal modelling. What is a transformer in NLP? ling of the learned dependencies.Convolutional neural networks model the local context and many layers are required to del the long-term dependencies. Nowadays, transformers are used in various NLP tasks (text generation, text summarization, question answering, entailment, machine translation, etc.) and are also becoming more popular in f el Why is linearity a problem in a transformer? linearity in the representations. The transformer \u2019s encoder and decoder are composed of multiple complex layers, this indicating that the vanising gra ient problem is likely to appear. Residual connections solve this problem, by connecting lower layers to higher layers such that the gradients are allowed to flo Transformer architectures consume the lionshare of computational budgets associated with today\u2019s most powerful language and vision models, making research into greater computational efficiency a hot and essential direction.

Dec 3, 2025 \u00b7 Standard first line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer is immunotherapy but responses vary and consistent predictive biomarkers are lacking. Sep 1, 2025 \u00b7 In this study , we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of ctDNA as a surrogate biomarker of clinical response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC , using pretreatment and early on-treatment ctDNA levels. This study investigates the molecular characterization of never-smoking patients ( NS -pts) with high tumor mutation burden (H-TMB) in advanced non - small cell lung cancer ( aNSCLC ) and their response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO). Jun 3, 2023 \u00b7 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage NSCLC . investigated the effect of utilizing pembrolizumab along with chemotherapy against metastatic NSCLC . The results provide clinically critical references for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the management of NSCLC . Is CD63 an exosome marker in gastric cancer? Background: It has been reported that CD63, an exosome marker, is expressed in solid cancer tissues. However, its significance in patients with gastric cancer has not been clarified . Exosomes derived from cancer cells and stromal cells might play an important role in the intracellular communications involved in the development of carcinoma. Does neoadjuvant pembrolizumab improve resectable and early-stage NSCLC survival? Among patients with resectable, early-stage NSCLC, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab significantly improved event-free survival , major pathological response, and pathological complete response as compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone followed by surgery. Which molecular subsets have different immunotherapy outcomes in NSCLC patients? Here, using RNA-sequencing data from a large clinical trial in NSCLC patients, the authors define four molecular subsets with distinct tumour-intrinsic and -extrinsic features with differing outcomes to immunotherapy combinations. Does pembrolizumab cause recurrence? Event-free survival at 24 months was 62.4% in the pembrolizumab group and 40.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression, recurrence, or death, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001).\n---\nTitle: Brief Report: Prospective Trial of Pembrolizumab Monotherapy ...\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666364325000943\nSnippet: Sep 1, 2025 \u00b7 In this study , we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of ctDNA as a surrogate biomarker of clinical response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC , using pretreatment and early on-treatment ctDNA levels.\n---\nTitle: Exploring Genomic Biomarkers for Pembrolizumab Response: A ...\nURL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11639826/\nSnippet: This study investigates the molecular characterization of never-smoking patients ( NS -pts) with high tumor mutation burden (H-TMB) in advanced non - small cell lung cancer ( aNSCLC ) and their response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO).\n---\nTitle: Perioperative Pembrolizumab for Early-Stage Non\u2013Small-Cell ...\nURL: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2302983\nSnippet: Jun 3, 2023 \u00b7 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage NSCLC .\n---\nTitle: Pembrolizumab, Chemotherapy, and Metastatic NSCLC\nURL: https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(24)02327-X/fulltext\nSnippet: investigated the effect of utilizing pembrolizumab along with chemotherapy against metastatic NSCLC .

Dec 3, 2025 \u00b7 Standard first line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer is immunotherapy but responses vary and consistent predictive biomarkers are lacking. Sep 1, 2025 \u00b7 In this study , we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of ctDNA as a surrogate biomarker of clinical response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC , using pretreatment and early on-treatment ctDNA levels. This study investigates the molecular characterization of never-smoking patients ( NS -pts) with high tumor mutation burden (H-TMB) in advanced non - small cell lung cancer ( aNSCLC ) and their response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO). Jun 3, 2023 \u00b7 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage NSCLC . investigated the effect of utilizing pembrolizumab along with chemotherapy against metastatic NSCLC . The results provide clinically critical references for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the management of NSCLC . Is CD63 an exosome marker in gastric cancer? Background: It has been reported that CD63, an exosome marker, is expressed in solid cancer tissues. However, its significance in patients with gastric cancer has not been clarified . Exosomes derived from cancer cells and stromal cells might play an important role in the intracellular communications involved in the development of carcinoma. Does neoadjuvant pembrolizumab improve resectable and early-stage NSCLC survival? Among patients with resectable, early-stage NSCLC, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab significantly improved event-free survival , major pathological response, and pathological complete response as compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone followed by surgery. Which molecular subsets have different immunotherapy outcomes in NSCLC patients? Here, using RNA-sequencing data from a large clinical trial in NSCLC patients, the authors define four molecular subsets with distinct tumour-intrinsic and -extrinsic features with differing outcomes to immunotherapy combinations. Does pembrolizumab cause recurrence? Event-free survival at 24 months was 62.4% in the pembrolizumab group and 40.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression, recurrence, or death, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001).\n---\nTitle: Brief Report: Prospective Trial of Pembrolizumab Monotherapy ...\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666364325000943\nSnippet: Sep 1, 2025 \u00b7 In this study , we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of ctDNA as a surrogate biomarker of clinical response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC , using pretreatment and early on-treatment ctDNA levels.\n---\nTitle: Exploring Genomic Biomarkers for Pembrolizumab Response: A ...\nURL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11639826/\nSnippet: This study investigates the molecular characterization of never-smoking patients ( NS -pts) with high tumor mutation burden (H-TMB) in advanced non - small cell lung cancer ( aNSCLC ) and their response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO).\n---\nTitle: Perioperative Pembrolizumab for Early-Stage Non\u2013Small-Cell ...\nURL: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2302983\nSnippet: Jun 3, 2023 \u00b7 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage NSCLC .\n---\nTitle: Pembrolizumab, Chemotherapy, and Metastatic NSCLC\nURL: https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(24)02327-X/fulltext\nSnippet: investigated the effect of utilizing pembrolizumab along with chemotherapy against metastatic NSCLC .

However, hallucination in LLMs is a critical issue as it affects the quality of an LLM\u2019s response, reduces user trust and leads to the spread of misinformation. Do LLMs hallucinate the least? Our study shows that GPT-4 hallucinates the least when faced with perturbations; in contrast, other LLMs start hallucinating even with minor typos. Discover the latest articles , books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning. Large Language Model ( LLM ) is currently one of the most discussed topics in technology. Are large language models prone to hallucination? The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP), fueling a paradigm shift in information acquisition.

Large language models ( LLM ) are trained to understand and generate human-like language. While LLMs present a cutting-edge concept and their use is becoming wide. Are LLM hallucinations a challenge? Given the open-ended general-purpose attributes inherent to LLMs, LLM hallucinations present distinct challenges that diverge from prior task-specific models. This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations. Is Hallucination a problem in large language model (LLM)? You have full access to this open access article Large Language Model (LLM) has recently become almost a household term because of its wide range of applications and immense popularity. However, hallucination in LLMs is a critical issue as it affects the quality of an LLM\u2019s response, reduces user trust and leads to the spread of misinformation. Do LLMs hallucinate the least? Our study shows that GPT-4 hallucinates the least when faced with perturbations; in contrast, other LLMs start hallucinating even with minor typos. Discover the latest articles , books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning. Large Language Model ( LLM ) is currently one of the most discussed topics in technology. Are large language models prone to hallucination? The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP), fueling a paradigm shift in information acquisition. Nevertheless, LLMs are prone to hallucination , generating plausible yet nonfactual content.\n---\nTitle: Detecting hallucinations in large language models using ...\nURL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0\nSnippet: Jun 19, 2024 \u00b7 Our probabilistic approach, accounting for semantic equivalence, detects an important class of hallucinations : those that are caused by a lack of LLM knowledge.\n---\nTitle: \u201dMy AI is Lying to Me\u201d: User-reported LLM hallucinations in ...\nURL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12365265/\nSnippet: Using a mixed-methods approach, a heuristic-based User-Reported LLM Hallucination Detection algorithm were applied to identify 20,000 candidate reviews, from which 1,000 are manually annotated.\n---\nTitle: A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models ...\nURL: https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3703155\nSnippet: Jan 24, 2025 \u00b7 This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations .

The test involves a human evaluator who interacts with both a machine and a human through text-based communication. If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish the machine from the human, the machine is considered to have demonstrated intelligent behavior equivalent to that of a human [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test), [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/).\n\nTuring's original paper can be accessed in various formats, including a PDF version [here](https://phil415.pbworks.com/f/TuringComputing.pdf).\n\nRegarding the use of the Turing Test in modern LLM evaluation benchmarks, the test is often referenced as a foundational concept for assessing machine intelligence. However, it is not typically used as a direct benchmark in LLM evaluations today. Instead, LLMs are evaluated using a variety of benchmarks that test specific capabilities such as natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation [Evidently AI](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks), [Turing](https://www.turing.com/resources/understanding-llm-evaluation-and-benchmarks).\n\nIn summary, while the Turing Test is a seminal concept in AI, modern LLM evaluations use more specific and varied benchmarks to assess different aspects of language model performance.\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn1dp31ptv7kyIJxCkgZy1k4RGSfW", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n \"citation_resolvable\": \"unknown\",\n \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"yes\",\n \"overall_risk\": \"medium\",\n \"reasoning\": \"The response provides citations, but they are not directly verifiable from the response itself.
