The US Department of 9 Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued dozens of guidance documents. The US FDA has 10 taken a significant step by releasing its first comprehensive draft guidance on AI-driven regulatory 11 decision-making. Jan 23, 2025 \u00b7 The draft guidance acknowledges that the use of AI in the drug product life cycle is broad and rapidly evolving, and strongly encourages sponsors and other interested parties to engage early with FDA to discuss their specific AI model development and use plans. Aug 30, 2024 \u00b7 In this article, we endeavour to summarise the wide-ranging whitepaper, which, over the course of 33 pages, sets out the FDA \u2019s aim to understand the use of AI and ML in drug development . What is FDA guidance on artificial intelligence? The FDA issued draft guidance to provide recommendations on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) intended to support a regulatory decision about a drug or biological product\u2019s safety, effectiveness or quality. Can artificial intelligence support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently published its long-awaited draft guidance on considerations for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics, which provides a comprehensive, risk-based framework to help sponsors evaluate and manage AI models. How can Ai be used in drug development & regulatory evaluation? A key aspect to the appropriate application of AI modeling in drug development and regulatory evaluation is ensuring model credibility \u2014trust in the performance of an AI model for a particular context of use. Context of use is defined as how an AI model is used to address a certain question of interest. How can FDA Guidance help drug development? The guidance can 275 help drug development's changing landscape by addressing advanced methodology inte- 276 gration, interoperability, and RWE framework alignment gaps. 277 The FDA \u2019s draft guidance is a significant step in integrating AI and RWE into regu- 278 latory decision-making. Jan 17, 2025 \u00b7 On January 6, 2025, the US FDA released a highly anticipated guidance on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug development .

Turing to determine whether a computer can \u201cthink.\u201d What is Turing's 'can machines think' test? The test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" while working at the University of Manchester. It opens with the words: \"I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think? What is the standard interpretation of the Turing test? The \"standard interpretation\" of the Turing test , in which player C, the interrogator, is given the task of trying to determine which player \u2013 A or B \u2013 is a computer and which is a human. The interrogator is limited to using the responses to written questions to make the determination. What does it mean to pass the Turing test? In our view, at least when The Turing Test is properly understood, it is clear that anything that passes The Turing Test must have the ability to solve problems in a wide variety of everyday circumstances (because the interrogators will use their questions to probe these\u2014and other\u2014kinds of abilities in those who play the Imitation Game).

Early plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) changes to predict response to first-line pembrolizumab +/- chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ). Do circulating tumor DNA and plasma proteomics predict clinical outcomes to immunotherapy? Cancer Res. 12, 2310\u20132323 (2023). Murray, J. C. et al. Abstract 1668: Longitudinal dynamics of circulating tumor DNA and plasma proteomics predict clinical outcomes to immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. Does pembrolizumab therapy for Advanced PD-L1 + NSCLC improve PFS and OS? BR.36 stage 2 is a randomized phase 2/3 trial that will evaluate whether adding chemotherapy to pembrolizumab for patients with advanced PD-L1 + NSCLC who have persistent ctDNA at 6 weeks will result in better PFS and OS compared to patients who remain on pembrolizumab therapy until clinical progression. What is a proteomic workflow in NSCLC patients undergoing pembrolizumab? The proteomic workflow involved plasma extraction from blood samples of 64 NSCLC patients undergoing pembrolizumab. Ten mL of peripheral blood were obtained by direct venipuncture in CellSave tubes (Menarini, Silicon Biosystems) and processed within 96 h after blood collection for the discovery cohort. What is the sensitivity of ctDNA response to pembrolizumab? Maximal mutant allele fraction clearance at the third cycle of pembrolizumab signified molecular response (mR). The trial met its primary endpoint, with a sensitivity of ctDNA response for RECIST response of 82% (90% confidence interval (CI): 52\u201397%) and a specificity of 75% (90% CI: 56.5\u201388.5%).

Early plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) changes to predict response to first-line pembrolizumab +/- chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ). Do circulating tumor DNA and plasma proteomics predict clinical outcomes to immunotherapy? Cancer Res. 12, 2310\u20132323 (2023). Murray, J. C. et al. Abstract 1668: Longitudinal dynamics of circulating tumor DNA and plasma proteomics predict clinical outcomes to immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. Does pembrolizumab therapy for Advanced PD-L1 + NSCLC improve PFS and OS? BR.36 stage 2 is a randomized phase 2/3 trial that will evaluate whether adding chemotherapy to pembrolizumab for patients with advanced PD-L1 + NSCLC who have persistent ctDNA at 6 weeks will result in better PFS and OS compared to patients who remain on pembrolizumab therapy until clinical progression. What is a proteomic workflow in NSCLC patients undergoing pembrolizumab? The proteomic workflow involved plasma extraction from blood samples of 64 NSCLC patients undergoing pembrolizumab. Ten mL of peripheral blood were obtained by direct venipuncture in CellSave tubes (Menarini, Silicon Biosystems) and processed within 96 h after blood collection for the discovery cohort. What is the sensitivity of ctDNA response to pembrolizumab? Maximal mutant allele fraction clearance at the third cycle of pembrolizumab signified molecular response (mR). The trial met its primary endpoint, with a sensitivity of ctDNA response for RECIST response of 82% (90% confidence interval (CI): 52\u201397%) and a specificity of 75% (90% CI: 56.5\u201388.5%).
