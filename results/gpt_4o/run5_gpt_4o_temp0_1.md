The US Department of 9 Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued dozens of guidance documents. The US FDA has 10 taken a significant step by releasing its first comprehensive draft guidance on AI-driven regulatory 11 decision-making. Jan 23, 2025 \u00b7 The draft guidance acknowledges that the use of AI in the drug product life cycle is broad and rapidly evolving, and strongly encourages sponsors and other interested parties to engage early with FDA to discuss their specific AI model development and use plans. Aug 30, 2024 \u00b7 In this article, we endeavour to summarise the wide-ranging whitepaper, which, over the course of 33 pages, sets out the FDA \u2019s aim to understand the use of AI and ML in drug development . What is FDA guidance on artificial intelligence? The FDA issued draft guidance to provide recommendations on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) intended to support a regulatory decision about a drug or biological product\u2019s safety, effectiveness or quality. Can artificial intelligence support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently published its long-awaited draft guidance on considerations for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics, which provides a comprehensive, risk-based framework to help sponsors evaluate and manage AI models. How can Ai be used in drug development & regulatory evaluation? A key aspect to the appropriate application of AI modeling in drug development and regulatory evaluation is ensuring model credibility \u2014trust in the performance of an AI model for a particular context of use. Context of use is defined as how an AI model is used to address a certain question of interest. How can FDA Guidance help drug development? The guidance can 275 help drug development's changing landscape by addressing advanced methodology inte- 276 gration, interoperability, and RWE framework alignment gaps. 277 The FDA \u2019s draft guidance is a significant step in integrating AI and RWE into regu- 278 latory decision-making. Jan 17, 2025 \u00b7 On January 6, 2025, the US FDA released a highly anticipated guidance on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug development .

This includes recommendations for using AI to support regulatory decision-making regarding the safety, effectiveness, or quality of drugs and biological products. The FDA aims to ensure that AI applications are credible and transparent, encouraging stakeholder engagement [FDA Guidance](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/considerations-use-artificial-intelligence-support-regulatory-decision-making-drug-and-biological).\n\n2. **Recent Developments**: The FDA has issued comprehensive draft guidance for developers of AI-enabled medical devices, which may overlap with drug development in terms of regulatory considerations [FDA News](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-comprehensive-draft-guidance-developers-artificial-intelligence-enabled-medical-devices).\n\n3. **AI in Drug Development**: The FDA recognizes the increased use of AI/ML throughout the drug development lifecycle and has seen a significant increase in submissions using AI/ML components. This reflects the agency's commitment to facilitating innovation while ensuring drug safety and effectiveness [FDA Science and Research](https://www.fda.gov/science-research/science-and-research-special-topics/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-aiml-drug-development).\n\nUnfortunately, without access to the specific 2020 and 2022 guidance documents, I cannot provide a detailed comparison of changes between these editions.

First, we will make a short remark regarding the data preprocessing step, that will be useful when explaining the What is a transformer in a neural network? The transformer is a neural network component that can be used to learn useful representations of sequences or sets of data-points. The transformer has driven recent advances in natural language processing, computer vision, and spatio-temporal modelling.

General overviewThe classic architecture of a transformer consists of an encoder , represented by a stack of N encoder blocks/layers, and a decoder, represented by a ack of N decoder blocks/layers. First, we will make a short remark regarding the data preprocessing step, that will be useful when explaining the What is a transformer in a neural network? The transformer is a neural network component that can be used to learn useful representations of sequences or sets of data-points. The transformer has driven recent advances in natural language processing, computer vision, and spatio-temporal modelling. What is a transformer in NLP? ling of the learned dependencies.Convolutional neural networks model the local context and many layers are required to del the long-term dependencies. Nowadays, transformers are used in various NLP tasks (text generation, text summarization, question answering, entailment, machine translation, etc.) and are also becoming more popular in f el Why is linearity a problem in a transformer? linearity in the representations. The transformer \u2019s encoder and decoder are composed of multiple complex layers, this indicating that the vanising gra ient problem is likely to appear.

Artificial intelligence auditability and auditor readiness for auditing Artificial intelligence auditability and auditor readiness for auditing Making It Possible for the Auditing of AI : A Systematic Review of AI Making It Possible for the Auditing of AI : A Systematic Review of AI (PDF) Auditability of AI systems - Academia.edu\nURL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04739\nSnippet: Feb 4, 2025 \u00b7 This paper explores the concept of a responsible AI system from a holistic perspective, which encompasses four key dimensions: 1) regulatory context; 2) trustworthy AI technology along with standardization and assessments; 3) auditability and accountability; and 4) AI governance. Rising concern for the societal implications of artificial intelligencesystems has inspired a wave of academic and journalistic literaturein which deployed systems are audited for harm by investigatorsfrom outside the organizations deploying the algorithms. Mar 10, 2025 \u00b7 This paper offers both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for aligning AI with values like fairness, transparency, and accountability. Trust is not given\u2014it must be designed into AI systems from the outset. This paper discusses the challenges of AI audits , including fairness and transparency, and emphasizes the importance of auditors' competencies. Based on interviews with 23 AI professionals, it proposes an AI auditability framework and required competencies. How can AI improve audit quality research? Having detailed mapping of auditability measures and auditors\u2019 competency dimensions will also facilitate AI audit quality research and provide resources for measuring AI system auditability and auditors\u2019 and audit team\u2019s competency levels. The findings of the study also have implications for the accounting information system domain. Are AI systems auditable? AI audits are expected to ensure that AI systems function lawfully, robustly, and follow ethical standards (e.g., fairness). While the auditability for financial audits and information system audits has been well addressed in the literature, auditability of AI systems has not been sufficiently addressed . Do Ai audits need auditability measures? This study systematically summarizes the current academic work and government and industrial regulations on AI audits as well as identifies auditability measures appropriate for each audit area and each specific process to be audited. The parties and persons responsible for implementing each set of auditability measures are also specified. How many research articles have been reviewed about AI audits & auditability? We reviewed 117 research articles and 23 policy and technical documents that address AI audits and AI auditability. The Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI released in 2019 by the European Commission listed seven key requirements that AI systems should meet, among these transparency and accountability.\n---\nTitle: Artificial intelligence auditability and auditor readiness ...\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467089525000156\nSnippet: Dec 1, 2025 \u00b7 In this paper, we explore AI auditability measures and competencies required for conducting AI audits .

The test involves a human evaluator engaging in a text-based conversation with both a human and a machine, without knowing which is which. If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test, demonstrating intelligent behavior equivalent to that of a human [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test), [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/).\n\nTuring's original paper can be accessed for more detailed reading on the subject: [Computing Machinery and Intelligence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence).\n\nRegarding the use of the Turing Test in modern LLM evaluation benchmarks, it is often referenced as a foundational concept for assessing machine intelligence. However, the specific application of the Turing Test in LLM benchmarks is more about the philosophical underpinning rather than a direct implementation. Modern benchmarks for LLMs focus on specific capabilities like natural language understanding and generation, using predefined datasets and metrics [Built In](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/turing-test), [Evidently AI](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks).\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn1tZVfdLc6nYCjGawJquYZFoLhiq", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n \"citation_resolvable\": \"no\",\n \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"yes\",\n \"overall_risk\": \"high\",\n \"reasoning\": \"The response provides links to general sources like Wikipedia and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, but these are not specific citations that can be independently verified.
