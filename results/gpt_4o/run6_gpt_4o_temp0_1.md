The US Department of 9 Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued dozens of guidance documents. The US FDA has 10 taken a significant step by releasing its first comprehensive draft guidance on AI-driven regulatory 11 decision-making. Jan 23, 2025 \u00b7 The draft guidance acknowledges that the use of AI in the drug product life cycle is broad and rapidly evolving, and strongly encourages sponsors and other interested parties to engage early with FDA to discuss their specific AI model development and use plans. Aug 30, 2024 \u00b7 In this article, we endeavour to summarise the wide-ranging whitepaper, which, over the course of 33 pages, sets out the FDA \u2019s aim to understand the use of AI and ML in drug development . What is FDA guidance on artificial intelligence? The FDA issued draft guidance to provide recommendations on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) intended to support a regulatory decision about a drug or biological product\u2019s safety, effectiveness or quality. Can artificial intelligence support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently published its long-awaited draft guidance on considerations for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics, which provides a comprehensive, risk-based framework to help sponsors evaluate and manage AI models. How can Ai be used in drug development & regulatory evaluation? A key aspect to the appropriate application of AI modeling in drug development and regulatory evaluation is ensuring model credibility \u2014trust in the performance of an AI model for a particular context of use. Context of use is defined as how an AI model is used to address a certain question of interest. How can FDA Guidance help drug development? The guidance can 275 help drug development's changing landscape by addressing advanced methodology inte- 276 gration, interoperability, and RWE framework alignment gaps. 277 The FDA \u2019s draft guidance is a significant step in integrating AI and RWE into regu- 278 latory decision-making. Jan 17, 2025 \u00b7 On January 6, 2025, the US FDA released a highly anticipated guidance on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug development .

By utilizing LLMs , manual review efforts were reduced by 95%, enabling efficient and scalable analysis of FDA review documents. Ground-truth assessments validated the effectiveness of well-tuned LLM prompts, showcasing their potential to enhance the accuracy and scalability of RWE evaluations. In pursuit of this goal, the Taskforce envisions a model where LLMs , once trained, can be deployed universally across GCRSR member states\u2014thereby retaining their generalizability without sacrificing the nuanced understanding of individual regulatory contexts. How can large language models improve drug discovery and development? The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the drug discovery and development field marks a significant paradigm shift, offering novel methodologies for understanding disease mechanisms, facilitating drug discovery , and optimizing clinical trial processes. How do sponsors engage with the FDA on AI Model Validation & Risk Evaluation? FDA encourages sponsors to engage early with the agency by leveraging a credibility assessment plan to guide the discussion on AI model validation and risk evaluation. The timing of when this plan is presented to FDA will depend on the sponsor\u2019s chosen method of engagement. Are large language models a powerful tool for Biomedical Discovery? Gao S., Fang A., Huang Y., et al., \u201cEmpowering Biomedical Discovery With AI Agents,\u201d Cell 187 (2024): 6125\u20136151. [DOI] [PubMed] [Google Scholar] Data S1. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in many fields, including clinical pharmacology and translational medicine. How can drug and biologic sponsors validate AI models for FDA review?

By utilizing LLMs , manual review efforts were reduced by 95%, enabling efficient and scalable analysis of FDA review documents. Ground-truth assessments validated the effectiveness of well-tuned LLM prompts, showcasing their potential to enhance the accuracy and scalability of RWE evaluations. In pursuit of this goal, the Taskforce envisions a model where LLMs , once trained, can be deployed universally across GCRSR member states\u2014thereby retaining their generalizability without sacrificing the nuanced understanding of individual regulatory contexts. How can large language models improve drug discovery and development? The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the drug discovery and development field marks a significant paradigm shift, offering novel methodologies for understanding disease mechanisms, facilitating drug discovery , and optimizing clinical trial processes. How do sponsors engage with the FDA on AI Model Validation & Risk Evaluation? FDA encourages sponsors to engage early with the agency by leveraging a credibility assessment plan to guide the discussion on AI model validation and risk evaluation. The timing of when this plan is presented to FDA will depend on the sponsor\u2019s chosen method of engagement. Are large language models a powerful tool for Biomedical Discovery?

First, we will make a short remark regarding the data preprocessing step, that will be useful when explaining the What is a transformer in a neural network? The transformer is a neural network component that can be used to learn useful representations of sequences or sets of data-points. The transformer has driven recent advances in natural language processing, computer vision, and spatio-temporal modelling. What is a transformer in NLP? ling of the learned dependencies.Convolutional neural networks model the local context and many layers are required to del the long-term dependencies. Nowadays, transformers are used in various NLP tasks (text generation, text summarization, question answering, entailment, machine translation, etc.) and are also becoming more popular in f el Why is linearity a problem in a transformer? linearity in the representations.

General overviewThe classic architecture of a transformer consists of an encoder , represented by a stack of N encoder blocks/layers, and a decoder, represented by a ack of N decoder blocks/layers. First, we will make a short remark regarding the data preprocessing step, that will be useful when explaining the What is a transformer in a neural network? The transformer is a neural network component that can be used to learn useful representations of sequences or sets of data-points. The transformer has driven recent advances in natural language processing, computer vision, and spatio-temporal modelling. What is a transformer in NLP? ling of the learned dependencies.Convolutional neural networks model the local context and many layers are required to del the long-term dependencies. Nowadays, transformers are used in various NLP tasks (text generation, text summarization, question answering, entailment, machine translation, etc.) and are also becoming more popular in f el Why is linearity a problem in a transformer? linearity in the representations. The transformer \u2019s encoder and decoder are composed of multiple complex layers, this indicating that the vanising gra ient problem is likely to appear. Residual connections solve this problem, by connecting lower layers to higher layers such that the gradients are allowed to flo 1 day ago \u00b7 An educational overview of the NeurIPS 2025 conference.

Dec 3, 2025 \u00b7 Standard first line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer is immunotherapy but responses vary and consistent predictive biomarkers are lacking. Sep 1, 2025 \u00b7 In this study , we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of ctDNA as a surrogate biomarker of clinical response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC , using pretreatment and early on-treatment ctDNA levels. This study investigates the molecular characterization of never-smoking patients ( NS -pts) with high tumor mutation burden (H-TMB) in advanced non - small cell lung cancer ( aNSCLC ) and their response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO). Jun 3, 2023 \u00b7 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage NSCLC . investigated the effect of utilizing pembrolizumab along with chemotherapy against metastatic NSCLC . The results provide clinically critical references for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the management of NSCLC . Is CD63 an exosome marker in gastric cancer? Background: It has been reported that CD63, an exosome marker, is expressed in solid cancer tissues. However, its significance in patients with gastric cancer has not been clarified . Exosomes derived from cancer cells and stromal cells might play an important role in the intracellular communications involved in the development of carcinoma. Does neoadjuvant pembrolizumab improve resectable and early-stage NSCLC survival? Among patients with resectable, early-stage NSCLC, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab significantly improved event-free survival , major pathological response, and pathological complete response as compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone followed by surgery. Which molecular subsets have different immunotherapy outcomes in NSCLC patients? Here, using RNA-sequencing data from a large clinical trial in NSCLC patients, the authors define four molecular subsets with distinct tumour-intrinsic and -extrinsic features with differing outcomes to immunotherapy combinations. Does pembrolizumab cause recurrence? Event-free survival at 24 months was 62.4% in the pembrolizumab group and 40.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression, recurrence, or death, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001).\n---\nTitle: Brief Report: Prospective Trial of Pembrolizumab Monotherapy ...\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666364325000943\nSnippet: Sep 1, 2025 \u00b7 In this study , we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of ctDNA as a surrogate biomarker of clinical response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC , using pretreatment and early on-treatment ctDNA levels.\n---\nTitle: Exploring Genomic Biomarkers for Pembrolizumab Response: A ...\nURL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11639826/\nSnippet: This study investigates the molecular characterization of never-smoking patients ( NS -pts) with high tumor mutation burden (H-TMB) in advanced non - small cell lung cancer ( aNSCLC ) and their response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO).\n---\nTitle: Perioperative Pembrolizumab for Early-Stage Non\u2013Small-Cell ...\nURL: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2302983\nSnippet: Jun 3, 2023 \u00b7 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage NSCLC .\n---\nTitle: Pembrolizumab, Chemotherapy, and Metastatic NSCLC\nURL: https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(24)02327-X/fulltext\nSnippet: investigated the effect of utilizing pembrolizumab along with chemotherapy against metastatic NSCLC .

Dec 3, 2025 \u00b7 Standard first line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer is immunotherapy but responses vary and consistent predictive biomarkers are lacking. Sep 1, 2025 \u00b7 In this study , we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of ctDNA as a surrogate biomarker of clinical response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC , using pretreatment and early on-treatment ctDNA levels. This study investigates the molecular characterization of never-smoking patients ( NS -pts) with high tumor mutation burden (H-TMB) in advanced non - small cell lung cancer ( aNSCLC ) and their response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO). Jun 3, 2023 \u00b7 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage NSCLC . investigated the effect of utilizing pembrolizumab along with chemotherapy against metastatic NSCLC . The results provide clinically critical references for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the management of NSCLC . Is CD63 an exosome marker in gastric cancer? Background: It has been reported that CD63, an exosome marker, is expressed in solid cancer tissues. However, its significance in patients with gastric cancer has not been clarified . Exosomes derived from cancer cells and stromal cells might play an important role in the intracellular communications involved in the development of carcinoma. Does neoadjuvant pembrolizumab improve resectable and early-stage NSCLC survival? Among patients with resectable, early-stage NSCLC, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab significantly improved event-free survival , major pathological response, and pathological complete response as compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone followed by surgery. Which molecular subsets have different immunotherapy outcomes in NSCLC patients? Here, using RNA-sequencing data from a large clinical trial in NSCLC patients, the authors define four molecular subsets with distinct tumour-intrinsic and -extrinsic features with differing outcomes to immunotherapy combinations. Does pembrolizumab cause recurrence? Event-free survival at 24 months was 62.4% in the pembrolizumab group and 40.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression, recurrence, or death, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001).\n---\nTitle: Brief Report: Prospective Trial of Pembrolizumab Monotherapy ...\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666364325000943\nSnippet: Sep 1, 2025 \u00b7 In this study , we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of ctDNA as a surrogate biomarker of clinical response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC , using pretreatment and early on-treatment ctDNA levels.\n---\nTitle: Exploring Genomic Biomarkers for Pembrolizumab Response: A ...\nURL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11639826/\nSnippet: This study investigates the molecular characterization of never-smoking patients ( NS -pts) with high tumor mutation burden (H-TMB) in advanced non - small cell lung cancer ( aNSCLC ) and their response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO).\n---\nTitle: Perioperative Pembrolizumab for Early-Stage Non\u2013Small-Cell ...\nURL: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2302983\nSnippet: Jun 3, 2023 \u00b7 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage NSCLC .\n---\nTitle: Pembrolizumab, Chemotherapy, and Metastatic NSCLC\nURL: https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(24)02327-X/fulltext\nSnippet: investigated the effect of utilizing pembrolizumab along with chemotherapy against metastatic NSCLC .

Do LLMs have hallucinations? In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the nature of hallucinations within LLMs and furthermore explore effective techniques for detecting such inaccuracies in various real-world settings. Do LLM models hallucinate trends? Similarly, in financial forecasting, a model might hallucinate trends that do not align with real-world market data, misguiding decision-makers. Several studies have attempted to benchmark factual accuracy in LLMs, including Med-HALT, which specifically evaluates medical hallucinations and their impact . How to detect hallucinations in LLM outputs? Prior approaches to detect hallucinations in LLM outputs, such as consistency checks or retrieval-based methods, typically assume access to multiple model responses or large databases. These techniques, however, tend to be computationally expensive in practice, thereby limiting their applicability to real-time analysis. Why do legal LLM applications produce hallucinations? Legal LLM applications frequently produce hallucinations due to the nuanced interpretation required in legal reasoning .

Do LLMs have hallucinations? In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the nature of hallucinations within LLMs and furthermore explore effective techniques for detecting such inaccuracies in various real-world settings. Do LLM models hallucinate trends? Similarly, in financial forecasting, a model might hallucinate trends that do not align with real-world market data, misguiding decision-makers. Several studies have attempted to benchmark factual accuracy in LLMs, including Med-HALT, which specifically evaluates medical hallucinations and their impact . How to detect hallucinations in LLM outputs? Prior approaches to detect hallucinations in LLM outputs, such as consistency checks or retrieval-based methods, typically assume access to multiple model responses or large databases. These techniques, however, tend to be computationally expensive in practice, thereby limiting their applicability to real-time analysis. Why do legal LLM applications produce hallucinations? Legal LLM applications frequently produce hallucinations due to the nuanced interpretation required in legal reasoning .

This paper discusses the challenges of AI audits , including fairness and transparency, and emphasizes the importance of auditors' competencies. Based on interviews with 23 AI professionals, it proposes an AI auditability framework and required competencies. How can AI improve audit quality research? Having detailed mapping of auditability measures and auditors\u2019 competency dimensions will also facilitate AI audit quality research and provide resources for measuring AI system auditability and auditors\u2019 and audit team\u2019s competency levels. The findings of the study also have implications for the accounting information system domain. Are AI systems auditable? AI audits are expected to ensure that AI systems function lawfully, robustly, and follow ethical standards (e.g., fairness). While the auditability for financial audits and information system audits has been well addressed in the literature, auditability of AI systems has not been sufficiently addressed . Do Ai audits need auditability measures? This study systematically summarizes the current academic work and government and industrial regulations on AI audits as well as identifies auditability measures appropriate for each audit area and each specific process to be audited. The parties and persons responsible for implementing each set of auditability measures are also specified. How many research articles have been reviewed about AI audits & auditability? We reviewed 117 research articles and 23 policy and technical documents that address AI audits and AI auditability. The Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI released in 2019 by the European Commission listed seven key requirements that AI systems should meet, among these transparency and accountability.\n---\nTitle: Artificial intelligence auditability and auditor readiness ...\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467089525000156\nSnippet: Dec 1, 2025 \u00b7 In this paper, we explore AI auditability measures and competencies required for conducting AI audits .

Rising concern for the societal implications of artificial intelligencesystems has inspired a wave of academic and journalistic literaturein which deployed systems are audited for harm by investigatorsfrom outside the organizations deploying the algorithms. Mar 10, 2025 \u00b7 This paper offers both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for aligning AI with values like fairness, transparency, and accountability. Trust is not given\u2014it must be designed into AI systems from the outset. This paper discusses the challenges of AI audits , including fairness and transparency, and emphasizes the importance of auditors' competencies. Based on interviews with 23 AI professionals, it proposes an AI auditability framework and required competencies. How can AI improve audit quality research? Having detailed mapping of auditability measures and auditors\u2019 competency dimensions will also facilitate AI audit quality research and provide resources for measuring AI system auditability and auditors\u2019 and audit team\u2019s competency levels. The findings of the study also have implications for the accounting information system domain. Are AI systems auditable? AI audits are expected to ensure that AI systems function lawfully, robustly, and follow ethical standards (e.g., fairness). While the auditability for financial audits and information system audits has been well addressed in the literature, auditability of AI systems has not been sufficiently addressed . Do Ai audits need auditability measures? This study systematically summarizes the current academic work and government and industrial regulations on AI audits as well as identifies auditability measures appropriate for each audit area and each specific process to be audited. The parties and persons responsible for implementing each set of auditability measures are also specified. How many research articles have been reviewed about AI audits & auditability? We reviewed 117 research articles and 23 policy and technical documents that address AI audits and AI auditability.

The test evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. Turing's original idea was to replace the question \"Can machines think?\" with a more practical test involving a human judge interacting with both a human and a machine through text. If the judge cannot reliably distinguish the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence), [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/).\n\nTuring's definition of the test is often summarized as a machine's ability to exhibit behavior indistinguishable from a human's in a conversational context. This concept has become a foundational benchmark in evaluating artificial intelligence systems, including modern language models [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Turing-test), [HowStuffWorks](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/future-tech/alan-turing-test.htm).\n\nFor a direct quote from Turing's paper, you can refer to the original text of \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" where he discusses the imitation game and its implications for machine intelligence [UMBC](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf).\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn29M6ay48pMfNDwyl8lAmZj7ugyV", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n \"citation_resolvable\": \"unknown\",\n \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"yes\",\n \"overall_risk\": \"medium\",\n \"reasoning\": \"The response provides citations to multiple sources, but it does not specify exact pages or sections where Turing's definition can be found, making it difficult to verify the specific claims.
