The US Department of 9 Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued dozens of guidance documents. The US FDA has 10 taken a significant step by releasing its first comprehensive draft guidance on AI-driven regulatory 11 decision-making. Jan 23, 2025 \u00b7 The draft guidance acknowledges that the use of AI in the drug product life cycle is broad and rapidly evolving, and strongly encourages sponsors and other interested parties to engage early with FDA to discuss their specific AI model development and use plans. Aug 30, 2024 \u00b7 In this article, we endeavour to summarise the wide-ranging whitepaper, which, over the course of 33 pages, sets out the FDA \u2019s aim to understand the use of AI and ML in drug development . What is FDA guidance on artificial intelligence? The FDA issued draft guidance to provide recommendations on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) intended to support a regulatory decision about a drug or biological product\u2019s safety, effectiveness or quality. Can artificial intelligence support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently published its long-awaited draft guidance on considerations for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics, which provides a comprehensive, risk-based framework to help sponsors evaluate and manage AI models. How can Ai be used in drug development & regulatory evaluation? A key aspect to the appropriate application of AI modeling in drug development and regulatory evaluation is ensuring model credibility \u2014trust in the performance of an AI model for a particular context of use. Context of use is defined as how an AI model is used to address a certain question of interest. How can FDA Guidance help drug development? The guidance can 275 help drug development's changing landscape by addressing advanced methodology inte- 276 gration, interoperability, and RWE framework alignment gaps. 277 The FDA \u2019s draft guidance is a significant step in integrating AI and RWE into regu- 278 latory decision-making. Jan 17, 2025 \u00b7 On January 6, 2025, the US FDA released a highly anticipated guidance on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug development .

Skitka, Kathleen L. Mosier, and Mark Burdick in their 1999 paper. In this context, automation bias is described as the tendency of decision-makers to over-rely on automated cues and recommendations, often leading them to ignore contradictory manual information or outcomes.\n\nThe original source of the term seems to be attributed to the works of Skitka, Mosier, and Burdick. One of their significant papers in this field is titled \"Does automation bias decision-making?\" This focused on exploring how automation influences human judgment, specifically noting the propensity to place undue trust in automated systems, even when not entirely reliable [source](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Does-automation-bias-decision-making-Skitka-Mosier/8580dc7ba0f0d7eb1c2495ceb23af9491a805849).\n\nAutomation bias is broadly defined as the tendency to give undue priority or credibility to automated suggestions or systems at the expense of human judgment, which can sometimes result in following potentially erroneous recommendations provided by these systems. More clearly, this bias reflects a psychological tendency where humans favor the outputs of automated aids and devices, even when there is evidence to suggest these outputs may be incorrect [source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-025-02422-7).", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765799485, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_e819e3438b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 294, "prompt_tokens": 4125, "total_tokens": 4419, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 4125, "completion_tokens": 294, "agent_id": null}

This code was tested using Python 3.8 and PyTorch version 1.13.1. In our experiments on NLP tasks, we initialize word embeddings using 300-dimensional pre-trained GloVe embeddings, which can be downloaded here (Common Crawl, cased): See full list on github.com Training The code to learn a Transformer Program can be found in src/run.py. For example, the following command will train a Transformer Program for the sort task, using two layers, four categorical attention heads per-layer, and one-hot input embeddings:This command will train a Transformer Program for the CoNLL 2003 named-entity recognition task, learning input embeddings composed of four 32-dimensional categorical variables:Please see src/run.py for all of the possible arguments. The training data will either be generated (for the RASP tasks) or downloaded from Hugging Face Datasets; see src/utils/data_utils.py for the supported datasets. The scripts directory contains scripts for training Transformer Programs and standard Transformers with the experiment settings used in the paper . Converting to code Run the training script with the --save_code flag to convert the model to a Python program at the end of training. To convert a model that has already been trained, use src/decompile.py. For example,output/sort/ should be the output directory of a training run. See full list on github.com The programs directory contains example programs for small-scale versions of all of the RASP tasks, as well as named-entity recognition. Each program defines a function called run that takes a sequence of tokens as input and returns a list of predicted labels. For example: programs/rasp contains the best-performing programs for each task, using both categorical and numerical attention heads. programs/rasp_categorical_only contains the best-performing programs using only categorical variables. programs/conll_ner contains a program for named-entity recognition.

For example, the following command will train a Transformer Program for the sort task, using two layers, four categorical attention heads per-layer, and one-hot input embeddings:This command will train a Transformer Program for the CoNLL 2003 named-entity recognition task, learning input embeddings composed of four 32-dimensional categorical variables:Please see src/run.py for all of the possible arguments. The training data will either be generated (for the RASP tasks) or downloaded from Hugging Face Datasets; see src/utils/data_utils.py for the supported datasets. The scripts directory contains scripts for training Transformer Programs and standard Transformers with the experiment settings used in the paper . Converting to code Run the training script with the --save_code flag to convert the model to a Python program at the end of training. To convert a model that has already been trained, use src/decompile.py. For example,output/sort/ should be the output directory of a training run. See full list on github.com The programs directory contains example programs for small-scale versions of all of the RASP tasks, as well as named-entity recognition. Each program defines a function called run that takes a sequence of tokens as input and returns a list of predicted labels. For example: programs/rasp contains the best-performing programs for each task, using both categorical and numerical attention heads. programs/rasp_categorical_only contains the best-performing programs using only categorical variables. programs/conll_ner contains a program for named-entity recognition.

What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A comprehensive overview of RAG, its evolution from Naive RAG to Advanced and Modular RAG, and its key components. RAG in the Enterprise Context: Examining the benefits, challenges, and mitigation strategies for deploying RAG in enterprise environments. 2 days ago \u00b7 Here, we investigate existing RAG approaches and their potential combinations to identify optimal RAG practices. Through extensive experiments, we suggest several strategies for deploying RAG that balance both performance and efficiency. What is retrieval augmented generation (Rag)? To address the limitations mentioned above, researchers have introduced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a hybrid framework that combines the generative power of LLM with an external retrieval mechanism (Lewis et al., 2020). Does retrieval augmented generation improve math question-answering? E. Postle, and W. Xing, \u201c Retrieval - augmented generation to improve math question-answering: Trade-offs between groundedness and human preference,\u201d p. arXiv:2310.03184, October 01, 2023 2023. [Online]. What are the different types of metrics for retrieval augmented generation? They fall into four broad categories: (1) classification-based metrics, (2) overlap-based n-gram metrics, (3) probabilistic metrics, and (4) spe-cialised diversity and grounding metrics. Each offers unique insight and carries distinct limitations in the evaluation of retrieval - augmented generation . Why is retrieval-augmented generation important? However, LLMs still face several challenges, including hallucination and static internal knowledge, which hinder their reliability in educational settings.

To address the limitations mentioned above, researchers have introduced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a hybrid framework that combines the generative power of LLM with an external retrieval mechanism (Lewis et al., 2020). Does retrieval augmented generation improve math question-answering? E. Postle, and W. Xing, \u201c Retrieval - augmented generation to improve math question-answering: Trade-offs between groundedness and human preference,\u201d p. arXiv:2310.03184, October 01, 2023 2023. [Online]. What are the different types of metrics for retrieval augmented generation? They fall into four broad categories: (1) classification-based metrics, (2) overlap-based n-gram metrics, (3) probabilistic metrics, and (4) spe-cialised diversity and grounding metrics. Each offers unique insight and carries distinct limitations in the evaluation of retrieval - augmented generation . Why is retrieval-augmented generation important? However, LLMs still face several challenges, including hallucination and static internal knowledge, which hinder their reliability in educational settings.

Skitka, Kathleen L. Mosier, and Mark Burdick in their 1999 paper. In this context, automation bias is described as the tendency of decision-makers to over-rely on automated cues and recommendations, often leading them to ignore contradictory manual information or outcomes.\n\nThe original source of the term seems to be attributed to the works of Skitka, Mosier, and Burdick. One of their significant papers in this field is titled \"Does automation bias decision-making?\" This focused on exploring how automation influences human judgment, specifically noting the propensity to place undue trust in automated systems, even when not entirely reliable [source](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Does-automation-bias-decision-making-Skitka-Mosier/8580dc7ba0f0d7eb1c2495ceb23af9491a805849).\n\nAutomation bias is broadly defined as the tendency to give undue priority or credibility to automated suggestions or systems at the expense of human judgment, which can sometimes result in following potentially erroneous recommendations provided by these systems. More clearly, this bias reflects a psychological tendency where humans favor the outputs of automated aids and devices, even when there is evidence to suggest these outputs may be incorrect [source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-025-02422-7).\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn1RUffTB42mzNpznUQDWSgDBXosq", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n    \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n    \"citation_resolvable\": \"unknown\",\n    \"fabricated_details\": \"yes\",\n    \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"yes\",\n    \"overall_risk\": \"high\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The response cites specific works and authors, but no clear or verifiable reference is provided (e.g., DOI, publication name), making it difficult to confirm its existence.
