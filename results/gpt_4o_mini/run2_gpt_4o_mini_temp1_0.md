Turing stated that the test involves a scenario where a human evaluator engages in a conversation with both a human and a machine, without knowing which is which. The goal is to determine if the machine can exhibit behavior indistinguishable from that of the human participant.\n\n### Turing's Definition\nIn his original proposal, Turing famously posed the question, \"Can machines think?\" and suggested that this question was too ambiguous to address directly. Instead, he proposed the imitation game as a more practical approach to evaluating machine intelligence. He elaborated:\n\n> \"I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?' This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms 'machine' and 'think.'\" \n> (Turing, 1950)\n\nThe Turing Test assesses whether a machine's outputs are indistinguishable from a human's during these conversations, thereby evaluating the machine's ability to simulate human-like behavior in communication.\n\n### Citations\n1.

This included considerations for the data quality, risk assessment, and transparency of AI algorithms involved in drug discovery processes.\n\n2. **2022 Guidance**: In 2022, the FDA provided a more comprehensive update that specified and expanded the applicability of AI in drug and biological product development. It focused on integrating AI in the entire drug lifecycle and emphasized a risk-based approach for assessing the efficacy and safety of AI-assisted models used in regulatory submissions.\n\n### Key Changes Between 2020 and 2022 Versions\n- **Scope and Detail**: The 2022 guidance includes a broader context of AI applications beyond initial device-centric applications, emphasizing its role in the drug development lifecycle\u2014from early research to post-marketing assessments.\n- **Framework Updates**: The 2020 guidance laid out general principles, while the 2022 version introduced a concrete **seven-step framework** for developing risk assessments of AI models. This framework is more structured, providing detailed pathways for analyzing the performance of AI models.\n- **Encouragement of Early Engagement**: The 2022 guidance strongly encourages sponsors to engage early with the FDA to align AI model development with regulatory expectations. This was less emphasized in the previous guidance.\n- **Stakeholder Interaction**: The 2022 guidance calls for more interaction with stakeholders to foster innovation while ensuring regulatory compliance, which reflects a shift towards collaboration.\n- **Performance Assessment**: Introduction of specific considerations on how to assess AI model performance more robustly, addressing concerns about utility, reliability, and the influence of AI outputs on drug safety and effectiveness claims.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **Risks Associated with AI Outputs**: The 2022 document highlights the need for transparency and robust validation of AI models to mitigate risks given their significant influence on clinical outcomes.\n- **Regulatory Expectations**: There is a clearer outline in the 2022 guidance regarding what is expected from developers of AI systems, particularly in terms of validation data and the potential biases in AI algorithms.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe 2022 FDA guidance represents a significant evolution from the 2020 version, focusing on a comprehensive approach to AI in drug discovery and regulatory submissions. The advancements reflect a more detailed and structured framework that addresses emerging challenges associated with AI technologies in pharmaceutical development.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to specialized articles discussing the changes, such as those on [FDA\u2019s official website](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-proposes-framework-advance-credibility-ai-models-used-drug-and-biological-product-submissions) and analyses available on various legal and regulatory platforms:\n- [McDermott Will & Emery](https://www.mwe.com/insights/fda-reveals-ai-development-cheat-sheet-in-highly-anticipated-draft-guidances/).\n- [Avancer](https://avancer.co/our-insights/articles/articles/harnessing-artificial-intelligence-in-drug-and-biological-product-development-a-strategic-overview-of-the-fdas-draft-guidance-for-stakeholders).", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765799048, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_aa07c96156", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 691, "prompt_tokens": 6920, "total_tokens": 7611, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 6920, "completion_tokens": 691, "agent_id": null}

This study investigated various biomarkers, including CD63, to assess their predictive value for treatment response. The findings indicated that plasma protein markers could be leveraged to predict responses to immunotherapy treatments effectively (Source: [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947624001245)).\n\n2. **Inflammatory Indexes and Treatment Response**: Another relevant article examined the impact of inflammatory indexes and certain biomarkers, including CD63, to correlate with treatment outcomes in NSCLC patients receiving pembrolizumab. This study strengthens the evidence of CD63's potential as a predictor of treatment response, as it focuses on immune-related markers associated with pembrolizumab efficacy (Source: [Journal of Thoracic Oncology](<https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(23)00317-9/fulltext>)).\n\n3. **Identifying Circulating Biomarkers**: Research highlighted in \"Exploring Genomic Biomarkers for Pembrolizumab Response\" suggests significant progress in identifying peripheral biomarkers that may predict responses to pembrolizumab treatment, with mention of CD63 and extracellular vesicles playing a notable role in this context (Source: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11639826/)).\n\n4. **Studies on Cancer Immunology**: The \"Real-world evidence for pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer\" article discusses the varied responsiveness to treatment based on biomarkers that may include metrics like CD63. While specific evidence linking CD63 to pembrolizumab is still emerging, the groundwork suggests its potential relevance (Source: [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-024-02895-1)).\n\nThese studies collectively suggest that CD63, as part of the extracellular vesicle proteome, may play a role in predicting response to pembrolizumab in NSCLC, supporting further investigation to validate its use in clinical settings.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765799098, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_aa07c96156", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 484, "prompt_tokens": 10551, "total_tokens": 11035, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 10551, "completion_tokens": 484, "agent_id": null}

Turing stated that the test involves a scenario where a human evaluator engages in a conversation with both a human and a machine, without knowing which is which. The goal is to determine if the machine can exhibit behavior indistinguishable from that of the human participant.\n\n### Turing's Definition\nIn his original proposal, Turing famously posed the question, \"Can machines think?\" and suggested that this question was too ambiguous to address directly. Instead, he proposed the imitation game as a more practical approach to evaluating machine intelligence. He elaborated:\n\n> \"I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?' This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms 'machine' and 'think.'\" \n> (Turing, 1950)\n\nThe Turing Test assesses whether a machine's outputs are indistinguishable from a human's during these conversations, thereby evaluating the machine's ability to simulate human-like behavior in communication.\n\n### Citations\n1.

This study investigated various biomarkers, including CD63, to assess their predictive value for treatment response. The findings indicated that plasma protein markers could be leveraged to predict responses to immunotherapy treatments effectively (Source: [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947624001245)).\n\n2. **Inflammatory Indexes and Treatment Response**: Another relevant article examined the impact of inflammatory indexes and certain biomarkers, including CD63, to correlate with treatment outcomes in NSCLC patients receiving pembrolizumab. This study strengthens the evidence of CD63's potential as a predictor of treatment response, as it focuses on immune-related markers associated with pembrolizumab efficacy (Source: [Journal of Thoracic Oncology](<https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(23)00317-9/fulltext>)).\n\n3. **Identifying Circulating Biomarkers**: Research highlighted in \"Exploring Genomic Biomarkers for Pembrolizumab Response\" suggests significant progress in identifying peripheral biomarkers that may predict responses to pembrolizumab treatment, with mention of CD63 and extracellular vesicles playing a notable role in this context (Source: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11639826/)).\n\n4. **Studies on Cancer Immunology**: The \"Real-world evidence for pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer\" article discusses the varied responsiveness to treatment based on biomarkers that may include metrics like CD63. While specific evidence linking CD63 to pembrolizumab is still emerging, the groundwork suggests its potential relevance (Source: [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-024-02895-1)).\n\nThese studies collectively suggest that CD63, as part of the extracellular vesicle proteome, may play a role in predicting response to pembrolizumab in NSCLC, supporting further investigation to validate its use in clinical settings.\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn1KgqIrhG8BIXZKNu4XBEGuKwKIL", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n \"citation_resolvable\": \"no\",\n \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"no\",\n \"overall_risk\": \"high\",\n \"reasoning\": \"The references to studies and articles provided include titles and sources, but without verifying the actual content, the cited sources may not correspond to the claims made in the response.
