The US Department of 9 Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued dozens of guidance documents. The US FDA has 10 taken a significant step by releasing its first comprehensive draft guidance on AI-driven regulatory 11 decision-making. Jan 23, 2025 \u00b7 The draft guidance acknowledges that the use of AI in the drug product life cycle is broad and rapidly evolving, and strongly encourages sponsors and other interested parties to engage early with FDA to discuss their specific AI model development and use plans. Aug 30, 2024 \u00b7 In this article, we endeavour to summarise the wide-ranging whitepaper, which, over the course of 33 pages, sets out the FDA \u2019s aim to understand the use of AI and ML in drug development . What is FDA guidance on artificial intelligence? The FDA issued draft guidance to provide recommendations on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) intended to support a regulatory decision about a drug or biological product\u2019s safety, effectiveness or quality. Can artificial intelligence support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently published its long-awaited draft guidance on considerations for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics, which provides a comprehensive, risk-based framework to help sponsors evaluate and manage AI models. How can Ai be used in drug development & regulatory evaluation? A key aspect to the appropriate application of AI modeling in drug development and regulatory evaluation is ensuring model credibility \u2014trust in the performance of an AI model for a particular context of use. Context of use is defined as how an AI model is used to address a certain question of interest. How can FDA Guidance help drug development? The guidance can 275 help drug development's changing landscape by addressing advanced methodology inte- 276 gration, interoperability, and RWE framework alignment gaps. 277 The FDA \u2019s draft guidance is a significant step in integrating AI and RWE into regu- 278 latory decision-making. Jan 17, 2025 \u00b7 On January 6, 2025, the US FDA released a highly anticipated guidance on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug development .

Here are the key changes and comparisons:\n\n1. **Scope and Focus**:\n - **2020 Guidance**: The initial guidance primarily focused on the use of AI and machine learning (ML) in the context of drug development, emphasizing the need for transparency and validation of AI models.\n - **2022 Guidance**: The updated guidance expands the scope to include a broader range of AI applications throughout the drug product lifecycle, not just during development. It emphasizes the importance of early engagement with the FDA for sponsors developing AI models, indicating a shift towards a more collaborative approach.\n\n2. **Regulatory Framework**:\n - **2020 Guidance**: The framework was more general, outlining basic principles for AI use in drug development.\n - **2022 Guidance**: The updated document provides a more structured framework for regulatory submissions involving AI, detailing specific considerations for the validation and reliability of AI models. It encourages the use of predetermined change control plans (PCCPs) for AI/ML-enabled medical devices, which was not explicitly mentioned in the 2020 guidance.\n\n3. **Engagement with Stakeholders**:\n - **2020 Guidance**: While it encouraged communication, the emphasis was less pronounced.\n - **2022 Guidance**: There is a stronger emphasis on the need for sponsors to engage with the FDA early in the development process to discuss their AI model development and use plans. This reflects a recognition of the complexities involved in AI applications and the need for tailored regulatory pathways.\n\n4. **Data and Model Transparency**:\n - **2020 Guidance**: The focus was on the need for transparency in AI algorithms and data sources.\n - **2022 Guidance**: The updated guidance reiterates the importance of transparency but adds specific recommendations for documenting the data used to train AI models and the rationale behind model choices, enhancing accountability.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**:\n - **2020 Guidance**: Risk assessment was mentioned but lacked detailed guidance.\n - **2022 Guidance**: The 2022 version includes more comprehensive recommendations for risk assessment related to AI applications, including considerations for model performance and potential biases in AI systems.\n\n### Sources:\n- FDA Draft Guidance on AI in Drug Development (2022): [FDA Guidance Document](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/considerations-use-artificial-intelligence-support-regulatory-decision-making-drug-and-biological)\n- Overview of FDA AI Guidance Changes: [Hogan Lovells](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/fda-unveils-longawaited-guidance-on-ai-use-to-support-drug-and-biologic-development)\n\nThese changes reflect the FDA's evolving understanding of AI's role in drug discovery and its commitment to ensuring that AI technologies are used safely and effectively in the pharmaceutical industry.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765802680, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_aa07c96156", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 605, "prompt_tokens": 6735, "total_tokens": 7340, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 6735, "completion_tokens": 605, "agent_id": null}

The key paper often referenced is \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al., which introduced the transformer architecture.

Attention Is All You Need. In _Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems_ (NeurIPS 2017). Available at: [arXiv:1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).\n\n### Quoted Theorem\nThe paper does not explicitly state a theorem in the traditional sense, but it introduces the concept of self-attention and provides a framework for understanding how attention mechanisms can be used to process sequences of data. A key equation from the paper is the scaled dot-product attention, which is defined as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( Q \\) is the query matrix,\n- \\( K \\) is the key matrix,\n- \\( V \\) is the value matrix,\n- \\( d_k \\) is the dimension of the keys.\n\nThis equation is fundamental to the operation of the transformer architecture, allowing it to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data dynamically.\n\nIf you need more specific details or additional quotes from the paper, please let me know!", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765802712, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_aa07c96156", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 2130, "total_tokens": 2481, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 2130, "completion_tokens": 351, "agent_id": null}

Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Extracellular Vesicles as Biomarkers**: A study highlighted the potential of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy. The study specifically noted that CD63, a tetraspanin protein found in EVs, could be part of a proteomic signature that correlates with treatment response to pembrolizumab. This suggests that CD63 may serve as a predictive marker for immunotherapy efficacy in NSCLC patients (Source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379000233_Validation_of_a_multiomic_model_of_plasma_extracellular_vesicle_PD-L1_and_radiomics_for_prediction_of_response_to_immunotherapy_in_NSCLC)).\n\n2. **Clinical Evidence from Trials**: Another source discussed the dynamics of circulating EVs during treatment with pembrolizumab, indicating that monitoring these vesicles could provide insights into treatment efficacy. The study suggested that changes in EV profiles, including markers like CD63, could reflect patient responses to therapy (Source: [FEBS Journal](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1878-0261.13737)).\n\n3. **Proteomic Analysis**: A systematic review indicated that proteomic technologies, including the analysis of EVs, could identify predictive biomarkers for responses to immunotherapy in NSCLC. CD63 was mentioned as a relevant marker in this context, emphasizing its potential role in predicting responses to pembrolizumab (Source: [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947624001245)).\n\n4. **Longitudinal Studies**: Research has shown that the serial evaluation of plasma tumor-derived EVs, including those expressing CD63, can longitudinally reflect responses and resistance to treatments like pembrolizumab in advanced NSCLC patients (Source: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12077285/)).\n\n5. **Emerging Biomarkers**: A recent study focused on the role of circulating EVs and their components, including CD63, as potential biomarkers for predicting responses to pembrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC. This study supports the idea that CD63 could be a valuable marker in clinical settings (Source: [Frontiers in Immunology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1540906/full)).\n\nThese findings collectively suggest that CD63, as part of the EV proteomic landscape, may serve as a predictive biomarker for responses to pembrolizumab in NSCLC, warranting further investigation in clinical settings.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765802730, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_aa07c96156", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 609, "prompt_tokens": 11016, "total_tokens": 11625, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 11016, "completion_tokens": 609, "agent_id": null}

To ensure the reliability of SciAssess, rigorous quality control measures have been implemented, ensuring accuracy , anonymization, and compliance with copyright standards. Large language models ( LLMs ) such as DeepSeek, ChatGPT, and ChatGLM have significant limitations in generating citations, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of academic research. These models tend to produce citations that are correctly formatted but fictional in content, misleading users and undermining academic rigor. Given the significant potential of leveraging LLMs as scientific literature analysis assistants to boost scientific discovery, we propose SciAssess as a more comprehensive benchmark, in terms of tasks, scopes, and modalities. Apr 30, 2025 \u00b7 Our analysis of nearly 5000 LLM -generated science summaries revealed that most models produced broader generalizations of scientific results than the original texts\u2014even when explicitly prompted for accuracy and across multiple tests. Nov 20, 2023 \u00b7 Large Language Models ( LLMs ) pose a direct threat to science , because of so-called \u2018hallucinations\u2019 (untruthful responses), and should be restricted to protect scientific truth, says a new paper from leading Artificial Intelligence researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute. Why do LLMs fail? MIT researchers find large language models sometimes mistakenly link grammatical sequences to specific topics , then rely on these learned patterns when answering queries. This can cause LLMs to fail on new tasks and could be exploited by adversarial agents to trick an LLM into generating harmful content. What is a large language model (LLM)? You have full access to this article via your institution. Large language models (LLMs) are deep learning models with a huge number of parameters trained in an unsupervised way on large volumes of text. Should we use LLMs for scientific summaries? Relying solely on LLMs for writing scientific summaries can result in oversimplified texts that overlook crucial value judgements and lead to misinterpretations of study results. We should, therefore, proceed with caution when using LLMs for scientific summarization. Should the scientific community rely on LLMs? AK: Until more robust and reliable safeguards are in place, the scientific community should take a timely and firm stance to avoid any overreliance on LLMs and to foster practices of responsible science in the age of LLMs. Otherwise, the risk is to jeopardize the credibility of scientific knowledge.

Why do LLMs fail? MIT researchers find large language models sometimes mistakenly link grammatical sequences to specific topics , then rely on these learned patterns when answering queries. This can cause LLMs to fail on new tasks and could be exploited by adversarial agents to trick an LLM into generating harmful content. What is a large language model (LLM)? You have full access to this article via your institution. Large language models (LLMs) are deep learning models with a huge number of parameters trained in an unsupervised way on large volumes of text. Should we use LLMs for scientific summaries? Relying solely on LLMs for writing scientific summaries can result in oversimplified texts that overlook crucial value judgements and lead to misinterpretations of study results. We should, therefore, proceed with caution when using LLMs for scientific summarization. Should the scientific community rely on LLMs? AK: Until more robust and reliable safeguards are in place, the scientific community should take a timely and firm stance to avoid any overreliance on LLMs and to foster practices of responsible science in the age of LLMs. Otherwise, the risk is to jeopardize the credibility of scientific knowledge.

It emphasizes the importance of early engagement with the FDA for sponsors developing AI models, indicating a shift towards a more collaborative approach.\n\n2. **Regulatory Framework**:\n - **2020 Guidance**: The framework was more general, outlining basic principles for AI use in drug development.\n - **2022 Guidance**: The updated document provides a more structured framework for regulatory submissions involving AI, detailing specific considerations for the validation and reliability of AI models. It encourages the use of predetermined change control plans (PCCPs) for AI/ML-enabled medical devices, which was not explicitly mentioned in the 2020 guidance.\n\n3. **Engagement with Stakeholders**:\n - **2020 Guidance**: While it encouraged communication, the emphasis was less pronounced.\n - **2022 Guidance**: There is a stronger emphasis on the need for sponsors to engage with the FDA early in the development process to discuss their AI model development and use plans. This reflects a recognition of the complexities involved in AI applications and the need for tailored regulatory pathways.\n\n4. **Data and Model Transparency**:\n - **2020 Guidance**: The focus was on the need for transparency in AI algorithms and data sources.\n - **2022 Guidance**: The updated guidance reiterates the importance of transparency but adds specific recommendations for documenting the data used to train AI models and the rationale behind model choices, enhancing accountability.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**:\n - **2020 Guidance**: Risk assessment was mentioned but lacked detailed guidance.\n - **2022 Guidance**: The 2022 version includes more comprehensive recommendations for risk assessment related to AI applications, including considerations for model performance and potential biases in AI systems.\n\n### Sources:\n- FDA Draft Guidance on AI in Drug Development (2022): [FDA Guidance Document](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/considerations-use-artificial-intelligence-support-regulatory-decision-making-drug-and-biological)\n- Overview of FDA AI Guidance Changes: [Hogan Lovells](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/fda-unveils-longawaited-guidance-on-ai-use-to-support-drug-and-biologic-development)\n\nThese changes reflect the FDA's evolving understanding of AI's role in drug discovery and its commitment to ensuring that AI technologies are used safely and effectively in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn2HH263VSr9g4teBjvGyDs6vxg3O", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n \"citation_resolvable\": \"yes\",\n \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"no\",\n \"overall_risk\": \"medium\",\n \"reasoning\": \"The assistant provided citations that can be verified, but the specific details of changes between the 2020 and 2022 guidance are not directly sourced from the cited documents, which raises concerns about the accuracy of the comparisons.\"\n}", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765802863, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_aa07c96156", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 849, "total_tokens": 949, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 849, "completion_tokens": 100, "agent_id": null}

Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Extracellular Vesicles as Biomarkers**: A study highlighted the potential of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy. The study specifically noted that CD63, a tetraspanin protein found in EVs, could be part of a proteomic signature that correlates with treatment response to pembrolizumab. This suggests that CD63 may serve as a predictive marker for immunotherapy efficacy in NSCLC patients (Source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379000233_Validation_of_a_multiomic_model_of_plasma_extracellular_vesicle_PD-L1_and_radiomics_for_prediction_of_response_to_immunotherapy_in_NSCLC)).\n\n2. **Clinical Evidence from Trials**: Another source discussed the dynamics of circulating EVs during treatment with pembrolizumab, indicating that monitoring these vesicles could provide insights into treatment efficacy. The study suggested that changes in EV profiles, including markers like CD63, could reflect patient responses to therapy (Source: [FEBS Journal](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1878-0261.13737)).\n\n3. **Proteomic Analysis**: A systematic review indicated that proteomic technologies, including the analysis of EVs, could identify predictive biomarkers for responses to immunotherapy in NSCLC. CD63 was mentioned as a relevant marker in this context, emphasizing its potential role in predicting responses to pembrolizumab (Source: [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947624001245)).\n\n4. **Longitudinal Studies**: Research has shown that the serial evaluation of plasma tumor-derived EVs, including those expressing CD63, can longitudinally reflect responses and resistance to treatments like pembrolizumab in advanced NSCLC patients (Source: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12077285/)).\n\n5. **Emerging Biomarkers**: A recent study focused on the role of circulating EVs and their components, including CD63, as potential biomarkers for predicting responses to pembrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC. This study supports the idea that CD63 could be a valuable marker in clinical settings (Source: [Frontiers in Immunology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1540906/full)).\n\nThese findings collectively suggest that CD63, as part of the EV proteomic landscape, may serve as a predictive biomarker for responses to pembrolizumab in NSCLC, warranting further investigation in clinical settings.\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn2HQuSYjCZDAJy2acY13s1uSgqUp", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n \"citation_resolvable\": \"no\",\n \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"no\",\n \"overall_risk\": \"high\",\n \"reasoning\": \"The assistant provides multiple citations with links, but without specific details or verifiable information about the studies, the citations cannot be independently verified.
