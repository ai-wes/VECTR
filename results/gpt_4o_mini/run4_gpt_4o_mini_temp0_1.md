The US Department of 9 Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued dozens of guidance documents. The US FDA has 10 taken a significant step by releasing its first comprehensive draft guidance on AI-driven regulatory 11 decision-making. Jan 23, 2025 \u00b7 The draft guidance acknowledges that the use of AI in the drug product life cycle is broad and rapidly evolving, and strongly encourages sponsors and other interested parties to engage early with FDA to discuss their specific AI model development and use plans. Aug 30, 2024 \u00b7 In this article, we endeavour to summarise the wide-ranging whitepaper, which, over the course of 33 pages, sets out the FDA \u2019s aim to understand the use of AI and ML in drug development . What is FDA guidance on artificial intelligence? The FDA issued draft guidance to provide recommendations on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) intended to support a regulatory decision about a drug or biological product\u2019s safety, effectiveness or quality. Can artificial intelligence support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently published its long-awaited draft guidance on considerations for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics, which provides a comprehensive, risk-based framework to help sponsors evaluate and manage AI models. How can Ai be used in drug development & regulatory evaluation? A key aspect to the appropriate application of AI modeling in drug development and regulatory evaluation is ensuring model credibility \u2014trust in the performance of an AI model for a particular context of use. Context of use is defined as how an AI model is used to address a certain question of interest. How can FDA Guidance help drug development? The guidance can 275 help drug development's changing landscape by addressing advanced methodology inte- 276 gration, interoperability, and RWE framework alignment gaps. 277 The FDA \u2019s draft guidance is a significant step in integrating AI and RWE into regu- 278 latory decision-making. Jan 17, 2025 \u00b7 On January 6, 2025, the US FDA released a highly anticipated guidance on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug development .

A total of 128 articles met our inclusion criteria. Oct 3, 2024 \u00b7 This paper presents a comprehensive study of Retrieval - Augmented Generation ( RAG ), tracing its evolution from foundational concepts to the current state of the art. What is retrieval augmented generation (Rag)? To address the limitations mentioned above, researchers have introduced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a hybrid framework that combines the generative power of LLM with an external retrieval mechanism (Lewis et al., 2020). How effective is retrieval-augmented generation? While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides a powerful framework for generating grounded responses, its effectiveness depends heavily on how well the retrieval and generation steps are optimized . Several techniques have been developed to enhance retrieval accuracy, reduce latency, and improve the relevance of the final output. How does rag work with advanced AI paradigms? RAG mitigates these issues by integrating external retrieval mechanisms , allowing models to reference up-to-date, verifiable information sources. This article comprehensively explores RAG\u2019s latest advancements, limitations, mitigation strategies, and their coexistence with advanced AI paradigms.

A total of 128 articles met our inclusion criteria. Oct 3, 2024 \u00b7 This paper presents a comprehensive study of Retrieval - Augmented Generation ( RAG ), tracing its evolution from foundational concepts to the current state of the art. What is retrieval augmented generation (Rag)? To address the limitations mentioned above, researchers have introduced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a hybrid framework that combines the generative power of LLM with an external retrieval mechanism (Lewis et al., 2020). How effective is retrieval-augmented generation? While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides a powerful framework for generating grounded responses, its effectiveness depends heavily on how well the retrieval and generation steps are optimized . Several techniques have been developed to enhance retrieval accuracy, reduce latency, and improve the relevance of the final output. How does rag work with advanced AI paradigms? RAG mitigates these issues by integrating external retrieval mechanisms , allowing models to reference up-to-date, verifiable information sources. This article comprehensively explores RAG\u2019s latest advancements, limitations, mitigation strategies, and their coexistence with advanced AI paradigms. What technological advancements have been made in Rag? A detailed review of the significant technological advancements in RAG is provided, including key innovations in retrieval - augmented language models and applications across various domains such as question-answering, summarization, and knowledge-based tasks.\n---\nTitle: Systematic Review: Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nURL: https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2508.06401\nSnippet: Aug 8, 2025 \u00b7 Abstract: This systematic review of the research literature on retrieval - augmented generation ( RAG ) provides a focused analysis of the most highly cited studies published between 2020 and May 2025.

Here are the key changes and updates between the two editions:\n\n1. **Scope and Focus**:\n   - The 2020 guidance primarily addressed the use of AI in drug development, emphasizing the need for transparency and validation of AI models. It provided a framework for how AI could be integrated into the drug development process.\n   - The 2022 guidance expanded this scope to include a broader range of applications for AI, including its role in regulatory decision-making and the entire product lifecycle, from preclinical to post-marketing phases. This reflects a more comprehensive understanding of AI's potential impact on drug discovery and development.\n\n2. **Risk-Based Framework**:\n   - The 2020 guidance suggested a general approach to AI model validation but lacked a detailed risk-based framework.\n   - The 2022 guidance introduced a structured, risk-based framework for evaluating AI models, which includes specific steps for assessing the performance of AI systems used in regulatory submissions. This framework aims to ensure that AI tools are effective and fit for their intended purposes, enhancing the credibility of AI applications in drug development (FDA, 2022).\n\n3. **Engagement with FDA**:\n   - The 2020 version encouraged early engagement with the FDA but did not provide specific mechanisms for this interaction.\n   - The 2022 guidance emphasizes the importance of early and transparent communication with the FDA, outlining specific pathways for sponsors to discuss their AI model development and use plans. This change aims to facilitate better collaboration between the FDA and industry stakeholders (FDA, 2022).\n\n4. **Emphasis on Data Quality and Integrity**:\n   - The 2020 guidance mentioned data quality but did not elaborate on its critical role in AI model performance.\n   - The 2022 guidance places a stronger emphasis on the quality and integrity of data used in AI models, recognizing that the success of AI applications in drug discovery heavily relies on high-quality data inputs (FDA, 2022).\n\n5. **Regulatory Considerations**:\n   - The 2020 guidance provided a general overview of regulatory considerations for AI in drug development.\n   - The 2022 guidance includes more detailed regulatory considerations, including specific recommendations for the types of data and evidence that should be submitted to support the use of AI in regulatory decisions regarding drug safety, effectiveness, and quality (FDA, 2022).\n\n### References:\n- FDA.

NeurIPS Tutorial Master Deck - nips.cc Lecture 5 - The Transformer Architecture: Part I Lecture 5 - The Transformer Architecture: Part I Transformer Architectures - Springer Transformer Architectures - Springer Transformer Architectures - Springer Transformer Architectures - Springer\nURL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\nSnippet: Jun 12, 2017 \u00b7 We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse ones. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Our proposed tutorial surveys the bleeding edge of three complementary research threads that together comprise a significant part of the current industrial toolkit for achieving computational efficiency in Transformers : weights, layers and heads; Vision Transformer models pre-trained on JFT-300M dataset outperform ResNet-based baselines on all datasets, while taking substantially less compute to pretrain. Can vision Transformers be used outside NLP? Great Results With Transformers Outside NLP! Vision Transformer models pre-trained on JFT-300M dataset outperform ResNet-based baselines on all datasets, while taking substantially less compute to pretrain. Z. Lin et al. Evolutionary-scale prediction of atomic-level protein structure with a language model. What is the attention mechanism in a transformer model? In transformer models, the attention mechanism computes a weight matrix that represents the importance of each token in the input sequence relative to every other token. To visualize the attention maps, we can extract the attention weights from a pre-trained transformer model and plot them. What is a transformer in NLP? The \u2018Trans-former\u2019 class combines these layers to form the complete transformer model, incor-porating positional encodings and embedding layers for both the input and output sequences. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a groundbreak-ing model in the field of NLP that has set new benchmarks for various NLP tasks. How do linear transformers achieve a linear complexity? Efficient Attention with Linear Complexity: Linear Transformers, such as the Linear Transformer model, achieve linear complexity by decomposing the atten-tion mechanism and reordering computations to avoid the quadratic bottleneck. The key idea is to use kernel functions to approximate the attention weights. The Vision Transformer (ViT) introduced by Doso-vitskiy et al. (2020) and subsequent improvements like the Swin Transformer (Liu et al. 2021) demonstrate the potential of transformers to excel in various vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n---\nTitle: Review \u2014 Attention Is All You Need ( Transformer ) | Medium\nURL: https://sh-tsang.medium.com/review-attention-is-all-you-need-transformer-96c787ecdec1\nSnippet: In this paper : A new simple network architecture , the Transformer , based solely on attention mechanisms, is proposed, which dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.

We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse ones. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Our proposed tutorial surveys the bleeding edge of three complementary research threads that together comprise a significant part of the current industrial toolkit for achieving computational efficiency in Transformers : weights, layers and heads; Vision Transformer models pre-trained on JFT-300M dataset outperform ResNet-based baselines on all datasets, while taking substantially less compute to pretrain. Can vision Transformers be used outside NLP? Great Results With Transformers Outside NLP! Vision Transformer models pre-trained on JFT-300M dataset outperform ResNet-based baselines on all datasets, while taking substantially less compute to pretrain. Z. Lin et al. Evolutionary-scale prediction of atomic-level protein structure with a language model. What is the attention mechanism in a transformer model? In transformer models, the attention mechanism computes a weight matrix that represents the importance of each token in the input sequence relative to every other token. To visualize the attention maps, we can extract the attention weights from a pre-trained transformer model and plot them. What is a transformer in NLP? The \u2018Trans-former\u2019 class combines these layers to form the complete transformer model, incor-porating positional encodings and embedding layers for both the input and output sequences. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a groundbreak-ing model in the field of NLP that has set new benchmarks for various NLP tasks. How do linear transformers achieve a linear complexity? Efficient Attention with Linear Complexity: Linear Transformers, such as the Linear Transformer model, achieve linear complexity by decomposing the atten-tion mechanism and reordering computations to avoid the quadratic bottleneck. The key idea is to use kernel functions to approximate the attention weights. The Vision Transformer (ViT) introduced by Doso-vitskiy et al. (2020) and subsequent improvements like the Swin Transformer (Liu et al. 2021) demonstrate the potential of transformers to excel in various vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n---\nTitle: Review \u2014 Attention Is All You Need ( Transformer ) | Medium\nURL: https://sh-tsang.medium.com/review-attention-is-all-you-need-transformer-96c787ecdec1\nSnippet: In this paper : A new simple network architecture , the Transformer , based solely on attention mechanisms, is proposed, which dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.

Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Extracellular Vesicles and CD63**: A study highlighted that CD63, a tetraspanin protein found in extracellular vesicles (EVs), may serve as a biomarker for predicting responses to immunotherapy, including pembrolizumab. The study emphasized the importance of analyzing the proteomic profiles of EVs to identify predictive markers for treatment outcomes in NSCLC patients (source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379000233_Validation_of_a_multiomic_model_of_plasma_extracellular_vesicle_PD-L1_and_radiomics_for_prediction_of_response_to_immunotherapy_in_NSCLC)).\n\n2. **Clinical Trials and Biomarker Analysis**: Another source discussed the predictive value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and EVs in patients treated with pembrolizumab. The study indicated that specific markers, including those related to CD63, could correlate with treatment responses, suggesting that monitoring these markers might help in tailoring immunotherapy for NSCLC patients (source: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12077285/)).\n\n3. **Proteomic Signatures**: A recent study identified a proteomic signature that includes CD63, which was associated with the response to pembrolizumab in NSCLC. This suggests that CD63, among other proteins, could be part of a broader biomarker panel to predict treatment efficacy (source: [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947624001245)).\n\n4. **Monitoring Treatment Response**: Research has shown that the dynamics of circulating EVs, including those expressing CD63, can provide insights into the efficacy of treatments like pembrolizumab. This study supports the idea that CD63 could be a valuable marker for monitoring treatment responses in NSCLC (source: [FEBS](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/1878-0261.13737)).\n\n5. **Emerging Biomarkers**: The role of CD63 in the context of EVs is being explored as part of a larger effort to identify reliable biomarkers for predicting responses to immunotherapy in NSCLC. This includes ongoing research into the proteomic and genetic profiles of patients undergoing treatment (source: [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1114041/pdf)).\n\nIn summary, CD63 appears to be a promising biomarker for predicting responses to pembrolizumab in NSCLC, particularly when analyzed in the context of extracellular vesicles and proteomic profiles.

Agentic AI is not just another tool in the scientific toolkit but a paradigm shift: by allowing autonomous systems to not only collect and process data but also to independently hypothesize, experiment, and even make decisions, agentic AI could fundamentally change how we approach biology . Will ai transform wet lab work? He also imagines a future featuring specialized AI tools tailored for specific research tasks instead of one-size-fits-all solutions. He also acknowledges that automation and AI will likely transform traditional wet lab work. \u201cI think bench work is going to be more of a hobby, or maybe something done in universities,\u201d he reflects. What is agentic AI? Unlike traditional machine learning models, which require vast amounts of curated data and are typically designed to perform specific, narrow tasks, agentic AI systems can ingest unstructured and diverse datasets from multiple sources and can operate autonomously with a more generalist approach.\n---\nTitle: Agentic AI: Revolutionizing the Future of Biological Research ...\nURL: https://www.impactlab.com/2024/11/22/agentic-ai-revolutionizing-the-future-of-biological-research-and-medicine/\nSnippet: Nov 22, 2024 \u00b7 Owkin K uses AI agents that plan and execute experiments in fully automated, robotized wet labs , where patient-derived organoids simulate human biology in a more accurate and dynamic manner.

Here are the key changes and updates between the two editions:\n\n1. **Scope and Focus**:\n   - The 2020 guidance primarily addressed the use of AI in drug development, emphasizing the need for transparency and validation of AI models. It provided a framework for how AI could be integrated into the drug development process.\n   - The 2022 guidance expanded this scope to include a broader range of applications for AI, including its role in regulatory decision-making and the entire product lifecycle, from preclinical to post-marketing phases. This reflects a more comprehensive understanding of AI's potential impact on drug discovery and development.\n\n2. **Risk-Based Framework**:\n   - The 2020 guidance suggested a general approach to AI model validation but lacked a detailed risk-based framework.\n   - The 2022 guidance introduced a structured, risk-based framework for evaluating AI models, which includes specific steps for assessing the performance of AI systems used in regulatory submissions. This framework aims to ensure that AI tools are effective and fit for their intended purposes, enhancing the credibility of AI applications in drug development (FDA, 2022).\n\n3. **Engagement with FDA**:\n   - The 2020 version encouraged early engagement with the FDA but did not provide specific mechanisms for this interaction.\n   - The 2022 guidance emphasizes the importance of early and transparent communication with the FDA, outlining specific pathways for sponsors to discuss their AI model development and use plans. This change aims to facilitate better collaboration between the FDA and industry stakeholders (FDA, 2022).\n\n4. **Emphasis on Data Quality and Integrity**:\n   - The 2020 guidance mentioned data quality but did not elaborate on its critical role in AI model performance.\n   - The 2022 guidance places a stronger emphasis on the quality and integrity of data used in AI models, recognizing that the success of AI applications in drug discovery heavily relies on high-quality data inputs (FDA, 2022).\n\n5. **Regulatory Considerations**:\n   - The 2020 guidance provided a general overview of regulatory considerations for AI in drug development.\n   - The 2022 guidance includes more detailed regulatory considerations, including specific recommendations for the types of data and evidence that should be submitted to support the use of AI in regulatory decisions regarding drug safety, effectiveness, and quality (FDA, 2022).\n\n### References:\n- FDA.

The study emphasized the importance of analyzing the proteomic profiles of EVs to identify predictive markers for treatment outcomes in NSCLC patients (source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379000233_Validation_of_a_multiomic_model_of_plasma_extracellular_vesicle_PD-L1_and_radiomics_for_prediction_of_response_to_immunotherapy_in_NSCLC)).\n\n2. **Clinical Trials and Biomarker Analysis**: Another source discussed the predictive value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and EVs in patients treated with pembrolizumab. The study indicated that specific markers, including those related to CD63, could correlate with treatment responses, suggesting that monitoring these markers might help in tailoring immunotherapy for NSCLC patients (source: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12077285/)).\n\n3. **Proteomic Signatures**: A recent study identified a proteomic signature that includes CD63, which was associated with the response to pembrolizumab in NSCLC. This suggests that CD63, among other proteins, could be part of a broader biomarker panel to predict treatment efficacy (source: [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947624001245)).\n\n4. **Monitoring Treatment Response**: Research has shown that the dynamics of circulating EVs, including those expressing CD63, can provide insights into the efficacy of treatments like pembrolizumab. This study supports the idea that CD63 could be a valuable marker for monitoring treatment responses in NSCLC (source: [FEBS](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/1878-0261.13737)).\n\n5. **Emerging Biomarkers**: The role of CD63 in the context of EVs is being explored as part of a larger effort to identify reliable biomarkers for predicting responses to immunotherapy in NSCLC. This includes ongoing research into the proteomic and genetic profiles of patients undergoing treatment (source: [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1114041/pdf)).\n\nIn summary, CD63 appears to be a promising biomarker for predicting responses to pembrolizumab in NSCLC, particularly when analyzed in the context of extracellular vesicles and proteomic profiles. Further research is likely to solidify its role in clinical practice.\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn1pUZzGFb8arkFHNOOikwlAqB6wr", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n    \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n    \"citation_resolvable\": \"no\",\n    \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n    \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"no\",\n    \"overall_risk\": \"medium\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"While the assistant provides multiple citations, they are all linked to external sources that cannot be independently verified within the response itself.
