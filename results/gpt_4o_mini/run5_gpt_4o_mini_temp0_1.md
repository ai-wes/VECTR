The US Department of 9 Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued dozens of guidance documents. The US FDA has 10 taken a significant step by releasing its first comprehensive draft guidance on AI-driven regulatory 11 decision-making. Jan 23, 2025 \u00b7 The draft guidance acknowledges that the use of AI in the drug product life cycle is broad and rapidly evolving, and strongly encourages sponsors and other interested parties to engage early with FDA to discuss their specific AI model development and use plans. Aug 30, 2024 \u00b7 In this article, we endeavour to summarise the wide-ranging whitepaper, which, over the course of 33 pages, sets out the FDA \u2019s aim to understand the use of AI and ML in drug development . What is FDA guidance on artificial intelligence? The FDA issued draft guidance to provide recommendations on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) intended to support a regulatory decision about a drug or biological product\u2019s safety, effectiveness or quality. Can artificial intelligence support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently published its long-awaited draft guidance on considerations for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biologics, which provides a comprehensive, risk-based framework to help sponsors evaluate and manage AI models. How can Ai be used in drug development & regulatory evaluation? A key aspect to the appropriate application of AI modeling in drug development and regulatory evaluation is ensuring model credibility \u2014trust in the performance of an AI model for a particular context of use. Context of use is defined as how an AI model is used to address a certain question of interest. How can FDA Guidance help drug development? The guidance can 275 help drug development's changing landscape by addressing advanced methodology inte- 276 gration, interoperability, and RWE framework alignment gaps. 277 The FDA \u2019s draft guidance is a significant step in integrating AI and RWE into regu- 278 latory decision-making. Jan 17, 2025 \u00b7 On January 6, 2025, the US FDA released a highly anticipated guidance on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug development .

Instead of trying to define the meaning of the terms 'machine' and 'think', it is better to consider the question in a more practical way. We can set up an experiment which we call the 'Imitation Game'.\" (Turing, 1950)\n\nIn this game, a human evaluator interacts with both a human and a machine through a text interface. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell which participant is the machine, the machine is said to have passed the test.\n\n### Relevance to LLM Evaluation\nThe Turing Test has influenced modern benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs). These benchmarks often assess whether LLMs can generate human-like responses in conversation, similar to the original intent of Turing's test. The concept of indistinguishability between human and machine responses remains a foundational criterion in AI evaluations today.\n\n### Citations\n1. Turing, A. M.

Automation bias occurs in both naive and expert participants, cannot be prevented by training or instructions, and can affect decision making in individuals as well as in teams. What is automation bias? The tendency to over-rely on automated systems has its roots in a cognitive phenomenon known as automation bias (AB). As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to influence critical fields such as healthcare, law, and public administration, the need to unravel the mechanisms of AB has grown increasingly urgent (Romeo and Conti 2024). Should you aversion to AI and automation bias? Finally, on average, those with a substantial background in AI should be more evenly positioned between aversion to AI and automation bias \u2014in theory, relying on the AI system proportionate to its expected performance and accuracy. How can automation bias be mitigated? With regard to measures that can mitigate automation bias , such as making users aware of the reasoning process of the automation , increasing accountability for decisions , and the effect of training , , studies across multiple domains have demonstrated mixed effects , . What factors influence automation bias? Additional details are in the online appendix, where we connect each set of questions to the specific measure we use in the paper. We theorize above that experience, familiarity, knowledge, trust, and confidence are closely related but distinct factors that may influence rates of automation bias. Until recently, the evidence base on automation bias in decision-making had not emerged in the context of public administration. Instead, the existing studies spanned multiple elds where decision-making is salient. Aviation was the original .\n---\nTitle: Exploring automation bias in human\u2013AI collaboration: a review ...\nURL: https://philpapers.org/rec/ROMEAB-2\nSnippet: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and public administration, automation bias (AB)\u2014the tendency to over-rely on automated recommendations\u2014has emerged as a critical challenge in human\u2013AI collaboration.\n---\nTitle: Complacency and bias in human use of automation: An ...\nURL: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-22141-003\nSnippet: Automation bias results in making both omission and commission errors when decision aids are imperfect.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and public administration, automation bias (AB)\u2014the tendency to over-rely on automated recommendations\u2014has emerged as a critical challenge in human\u2013AI collaboration. Automation bias results in making both omission and commission errors when decision aids are imperfect. Automation bias occurs in both naive and expert participants, cannot be prevented by training or instructions, and can affect decision making in individuals as well as in teams. What is automation bias? The tendency to over-rely on automated systems has its roots in a cognitive phenomenon known as automation bias (AB). As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to influence critical fields such as healthcare, law, and public administration, the need to unravel the mechanisms of AB has grown increasingly urgent (Romeo and Conti 2024). Should you aversion to AI and automation bias? Finally, on average, those with a substantial background in AI should be more evenly positioned between aversion to AI and automation bias \u2014in theory, relying on the AI system proportionate to its expected performance and accuracy. How can automation bias be mitigated? With regard to measures that can mitigate automation bias , such as making users aware of the reasoning process of the automation , increasing accountability for decisions , and the effect of training , , studies across multiple domains have demonstrated mixed effects , . What factors influence automation bias? Additional details are in the online appendix, where we connect each set of questions to the specific measure we use in the paper. We theorize above that experience, familiarity, knowledge, trust, and confidence are closely related but distinct factors that may influence rates of automation bias. Until recently, the evidence base on automation bias in decision-making had not emerged in the context of public administration. Instead, the existing studies spanned multiple elds where decision-making is salient.

Here are the key changes and updates between the two editions:\n\n1. **Scope and Focus**:\n - The **2020 guidance** primarily focused on the considerations for using AI and machine learning (ML) in the development of drugs and biological products. It emphasized the need for transparency and validation of AI models.\n - The **2022 guidance** expanded on this by providing a more structured framework for integrating AI into the drug development process. It introduced a risk-based approach, outlining specific steps for evaluating AI models' performance and their intended use in regulatory decision-making.\n\n2. **Framework for Evaluation**:\n - The **2020 version** suggested general principles for AI use but lacked a detailed framework for assessing AI models.\n - The **2022 guidance** introduced a **seven-step framework** for evaluating AI models, which includes defining the intended use, assessing the model's performance, and ensuring that the model is fit for its intended purpose. This structured approach aims to enhance the credibility and reliability of AI applications in drug development.\n\n3. **Engagement with the FDA**:\n - The **2020 guidance** encouraged early engagement with the FDA but did not specify how this should be conducted.\n - The **2022 guidance** explicitly encourages sponsors to engage with the FDA early in the development process to discuss their AI model development plans. This is intended to facilitate a clearer understanding of regulatory expectations and requirements.\n\n4. **Emphasis on Data Quality**:\n - The **2020 guidance** mentioned the importance of data quality but did not elaborate on how it impacts AI model performance.\n - The **2022 guidance** places a stronger emphasis on the quality of data used to train AI models, highlighting that poor data quality can lead to unreliable outcomes and regulatory challenges.\n\n5. **Regulatory Decision-Making**:\n - The **2020 guidance** provided a broad overview of how AI could support regulatory decisions.\n - The **2022 guidance** specifies that AI models should produce data that directly supports regulatory decisions regarding the safety, effectiveness, or quality of drugs and biological products.\n\n### Sources:\n- FDA Guidance on Artificial Intelligence in Drug Development (2020): [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/media/167973/download)\n- FDA Guidance on AI and ML in Drug Development (2022): [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/media/167973/download)\n- Overview of the FDA's AI Guidance Updates: [DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/insights/publications/2025/01/fda-releases-draft-guidance-on-use-of-ai)\n\nThese changes reflect the FDA's evolving understanding of AI's role in drug discovery and its commitment to ensuring that AI applications are safe, effective, and reliable.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765801855, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_aa07c96156", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 590, "prompt_tokens": 9571, "total_tokens": 10161, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 9571, "completion_tokens": 590, "agent_id": null}

Hickingly, comparing the cancer cohorts against controls through the developed EV protein biomarkers test, an AUC of 0.95 (sensitivity of 71.2 % at 99.5 % specificity) was obtained, showing excellent capabilities for early cancer detection . Do circulating tumor DNA and plasma proteomics predict clinical outcomes to immunotherapy? Cancer Res. 12, 2310\u20132323 (2023). Murray, J. C. et al. Abstract 1668: Longitudinal dynamics of circulating tumor DNA and plasma proteomics predict clinical outcomes to immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. Are EVs a source of protein biomarkers for breast cancer? EVs are also exploited as a source of protein biomarkers for other reproductive cancers that occur in women, such as breast cancer (BC). BC is extremely common among cancer diagnoses in women, constituting more than 2 million of the newly detected cancers in 2020 worldwide . Are EVs a biomarker for lung cancer? EVs have also been employed as a fount of biomarkers for lung cancer , which is the most common among thoracic malignancies: putative biomarkers were found for lung cancer in general , specifically for non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer .

Are EVs a source of protein biomarkers for breast cancer? EVs are also exploited as a source of protein biomarkers for other reproductive cancers that occur in women, such as breast cancer (BC). BC is extremely common among cancer diagnoses in women, constituting more than 2 million of the newly detected cancers in 2020 worldwide . Are EVs a biomarker for lung cancer? EVs have also been employed as a fount of biomarkers for lung cancer , which is the most common among thoracic malignancies: putative biomarkers were found for lung cancer in general , specifically for non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer .

Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Extracellular Vesicles and CD63**: A study highlighted the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers in cancer, specifically mentioning CD63. The research indicated that the presence of CD63 in plasma EVs could correlate with treatment responses in NSCLC patients undergoing immunotherapy, including pembrolizumab. This suggests that CD63 may serve as a predictive marker for therapeutic efficacy (source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360778213_Circulating_extracellular_vesicles_carrying_Firmicutes_reflective_of_the_local_immune_status_may_predict_clinical_response_to_pembrolizumab_in_urothelial_carcinoma_patients)).\n\n2. **Clinical Trials and Biomarkers**: In a clinical trial context, the dynamics of circulating EVs, including markers like CD63, were evaluated for their ability to predict responses to pembrolizumab. The study found that changes in EV profiles could provide insights into patient responses, indicating that CD63 might be a valuable marker in this setting (source: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12077285/)).\n\n3. **Prognostic Impact of EVs**: Another study focused on the prognostic impact of baseline circulating EVs, including CD63, in patients treated with pembrolizumab. The findings suggested that higher levels of CD63 could be associated with better treatment outcomes, reinforcing its potential as a predictive biomarker (source: [SciSpace](https://scispace.com/papers/prognostic-impact-of-baseline-circulating-extracellular-3udu807p)).\n\n4. **Comprehensive Review**: A review article discussed the role of various EV proteins, including CD63, in the context of NSCLC and immunotherapy. It emphasized the need for further research to validate these markers in clinical settings, particularly for predicting responses to pembrolizumab (source: [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1114041/full)).\n\nThese sources collectively indicate that CD63, as part of the EV proteomics landscape, holds promise as a predictive biomarker for responses to pembrolizumab in NSCLC, although further validation in clinical trials is necessary.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765801907, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_aa07c96156", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 529, "prompt_tokens": 12232, "total_tokens": 12761, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 12232, "completion_tokens": 529, "agent_id": null}

An Overview What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)? - IBM What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)? An Overview A Comprehensive Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG ...\nURL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview\nSnippet: Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) is an architecture that augments the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT by adding an information retrieval system that provides grounding data. Adding an information retrieval system gives you control over grounding data used by an LLM when it formulates a response. For an enterprise solution, RAG architecture means that you can constrain generative AI to your enterprise content sourced from vectorized documents and images, and other data formats if you have embedding models for that content. The decision about which information retrieval system to use is critical because it determines the inputs to the LLM. The information retrieval system should provide: \u2022Indexing strategies that load and refresh at scale, for all of your content, at the frequency you require. \u2022Query capabilities and relevance tuning. The system should return relevant results, in the short-form formats necessary for meeting the token length requirements of LLM inputs. \u2022Security, global reach, and reliability for both data and operations. \u2022Integration with embedding models for indexing, and chat models or language understanding models for retrieval . See full list on learn.microsoft.com Microsoft has several built-in implementations for using Azure AI Search in a RAG solution. \u2022Azure AI Studio, use a vector index and retrieval augmentation. \u2022Azure OpenAI Studio, use a search index with or without vectors. \u2022Azure Machine Learning, use a search index as a vector store in a prompt flow. Curated approaches make it simple to get started, but for more control over the architecture, you need a custom solution. These templates create end-to-end solutions in: \u2022Python See full list on learn.microsoft.com A high-level summary of the pattern looks like this: \u2022Start with a user question or request (prompt). \u2022Send it to Azure AI Search to find relevant information. \u2022Send the top ranked search results to the LLM. \u2022Use the natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of the LLM to generate a response to the initial prompt. Azure AI Search provides inputs to the LLM prompt, but doesn't train the model. In RAG architecture, there's no extra training. The LLM is pretrained using public data, but it generates responses that are augmented by information from the retriever. See full list on learn.microsoft.com In Azure AI Search, all searchable content is stored in a search index that's hosted on your search service. A search index is designed for fast queries with millisecond response times, so its internal data structures exist to support that objective. To that end, a search index stores indexed content, and not whole content files like entire PDFs or images. Internally, the data structures include inverted indexes of tokenized text, vector indexes for embeddings, and unaltered text for cases where verbatim matching is required (for example, in filters, fuzzy search, regular expression queries). When you set up the data for your RAG solution, you use the features that create and load an index in Azure AI Search. An index includes fields that duplicate or represent your source content. An index field might be simple transference (a title or description in a source document becomes a title or description in a search index), or a field might contain the output of an external process, such as vectorization or skill processing that generates a representation or text description of an image. Since you probably know what kind of content you want to search over, consider the indexing features that are applicable to each content type: 1 The generally available functionality of vector support requires that you call other libraries or models for data chunking and vectorization. However, integrated vectorization (preview) embeds these steps. For code samples showing both approaches, see azure-search-vectors repo. 2 Skills are built-in support for AI enrichment. For OCR and Image Analysis, the indexing pipeline makes an internal call to the Azure AI Vision APIs. These skills pass an extracted image to Azure AI for processing, and receive the output as text that's indexed by Azure AI Search. Vectors provide the best accommodation for dissimilar content (multiple file formats and languages) because content is expressed universally in mathematic representations. Vectors also support similarity search: matching on the coordinates that are most similar to the vector query. Compared to keyword search (or term search) that matches on tokenized terms, similarity search is more nuanced. It's a better choice if there's ambiguity or interpretation requirements in the content or in queries. See full list on learn.microsoft.com Once your data is in a search index, you use the query capabilities of Azure AI Search to retrieve content. In a non-RAG pattern, queries make a round trip from a search client. The query is submitted, it executes on a search engine, and the response returned to the client application. The response, or search results, consist exclusively of the verbatim content found in your index. In a RAG pattern, queries and responses are coordinated between the search engine and the LLM. A user's question or query is forwarded to both the search engine and to the LLM as a prompt. The search results come back from the search engine and are redirected to an LLM. The response that makes it back to the user is generative AI, either a summation or answer from the LLM. There's no query type in Azure AI Search - not even semantic or vector search - that composes new answers. Only the LLM provides generative AI. Here are the capabilities in Azure AI Search that are used to formulate queries: See full list on learn.microsoft.com A RAG solution that includes Azure AI Search requires other components and code to create a complete solution. Whereas the previous sections covered information retrieval through Azure AI Search and which features are used to create and query searchable content, this section introduces LLM integration and interaction. Notebooks in the demo repositories are a great starting point because they show patterns for passing search results to an LLM. Most of the code in a RAG solution consists of calls to the LLM so you need to develop an understanding of how those APIs work, which is outside the scope of this article. See full list on learn.microsoft.com \u2022Use Azure AI Studio to create a search index. \u2022Use Azure OpenAI Studio and \"bring your own data\" to experiment with prompts on an existing search index in a playground. This step helps you decide what model to use, and shows you how well your existing index works in a RAG scenario. \u2022\"Chat with your data\" solution accelerator, built by the Azure AI Search team, helps you create your own custom RAG solution. \u2022Enterprise chat app templates deploy Azure resources, code, and sample grounding data using fictitious health plan documents for Contoso and Northwind. This end-to-end solution gives you an operational chat app in as little as 15 minutes. Code for these templates is the azure-search-openai-demo featured in several presentations.

An Overview What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)? - IBM What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)? An Overview A Comprehensive Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG ...\nURL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview\nSnippet: Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) is an architecture that augments the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT by adding an information retrieval system that provides grounding data. Adding an information retrieval system gives you control over grounding data used by an LLM when it formulates a response. For an enterprise solution, RAG architecture means that you can constrain generative AI to your enterprise content sourced from vectorized documents and images, and other data formats if you have embedding models for that content. The decision about which information retrieval system to use is critical because it determines the inputs to the LLM. The information retrieval system should provide: \u2022Indexing strategies that load and refresh at scale, for all of your content, at the frequency you require. \u2022Query capabilities and relevance tuning. The system should return relevant results, in the short-form formats necessary for meeting the token length requirements of LLM inputs. \u2022Security, global reach, and reliability for both data and operations. \u2022Integration with embedding models for indexing, and chat models or language understanding models for retrieval . See full list on learn.microsoft.com Microsoft has several built-in implementations for using Azure AI Search in a RAG solution. \u2022Azure AI Studio, use a vector index and retrieval augmentation. \u2022Azure OpenAI Studio, use a search index with or without vectors. \u2022Azure Machine Learning, use a search index as a vector store in a prompt flow. Curated approaches make it simple to get started, but for more control over the architecture, you need a custom solution. These templates create end-to-end solutions in: \u2022Python See full list on learn.microsoft.com A high-level summary of the pattern looks like this: \u2022Start with a user question or request (prompt). \u2022Send it to Azure AI Search to find relevant information. \u2022Send the top ranked search results to the LLM. \u2022Use the natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of the LLM to generate a response to the initial prompt. Azure AI Search provides inputs to the LLM prompt, but doesn't train the model. In RAG architecture, there's no extra training. The LLM is pretrained using public data, but it generates responses that are augmented by information from the retriever. See full list on learn.microsoft.com In Azure AI Search, all searchable content is stored in a search index that's hosted on your search service. A search index is designed for fast queries with millisecond response times, so its internal data structures exist to support that objective. To that end, a search index stores indexed content, and not whole content files like entire PDFs or images. Internally, the data structures include inverted indexes of tokenized text, vector indexes for embeddings, and unaltered text for cases where verbatim matching is required (for example, in filters, fuzzy search, regular expression queries). When you set up the data for your RAG solution, you use the features that create and load an index in Azure AI Search. An index includes fields that duplicate or represent your source content. An index field might be simple transference (a title or description in a source document becomes a title or description in a search index), or a field might contain the output of an external process, such as vectorization or skill processing that generates a representation or text description of an image. Since you probably know what kind of content you want to search over, consider the indexing features that are applicable to each content type: 1 The generally available functionality of vector support requires that you call other libraries or models for data chunking and vectorization. However, integrated vectorization (preview) embeds these steps. For code samples showing both approaches, see azure-search-vectors repo. 2 Skills are built-in support for AI enrichment. For OCR and Image Analysis, the indexing pipeline makes an internal call to the Azure AI Vision APIs. These skills pass an extracted image to Azure AI for processing, and receive the output as text that's indexed by Azure AI Search. Vectors provide the best accommodation for dissimilar content (multiple file formats and languages) because content is expressed universally in mathematic representations. Vectors also support similarity search: matching on the coordinates that are most similar to the vector query. Compared to keyword search (or term search) that matches on tokenized terms, similarity search is more nuanced. It's a better choice if there's ambiguity or interpretation requirements in the content or in queries. See full list on learn.microsoft.com Once your data is in a search index, you use the query capabilities of Azure AI Search to retrieve content. In a non-RAG pattern, queries make a round trip from a search client. The query is submitted, it executes on a search engine, and the response returned to the client application. The response, or search results, consist exclusively of the verbatim content found in your index. In a RAG pattern, queries and responses are coordinated between the search engine and the LLM. A user's question or query is forwarded to both the search engine and to the LLM as a prompt. The search results come back from the search engine and are redirected to an LLM. The response that makes it back to the user is generative AI, either a summation or answer from the LLM. There's no query type in Azure AI Search - not even semantic or vector search - that composes new answers. Only the LLM provides generative AI. Here are the capabilities in Azure AI Search that are used to formulate queries: See full list on learn.microsoft.com A RAG solution that includes Azure AI Search requires other components and code to create a complete solution. Whereas the previous sections covered information retrieval through Azure AI Search and which features are used to create and query searchable content, this section introduces LLM integration and interaction. Notebooks in the demo repositories are a great starting point because they show patterns for passing search results to an LLM. Most of the code in a RAG solution consists of calls to the LLM so you need to develop an understanding of how those APIs work, which is outside the scope of this article. See full list on learn.microsoft.com \u2022Use Azure AI Studio to create a search index. \u2022Use Azure OpenAI Studio and \"bring your own data\" to experiment with prompts on an existing search index in a playground. This step helps you decide what model to use, and shows you how well your existing index works in a RAG scenario. \u2022\"Chat with your data\" solution accelerator, built by the Azure AI Search team, helps you create your own custom RAG solution. \u2022Enterprise chat app templates deploy Azure resources, code, and sample grounding data using fictitious health plan documents for Contoso and Northwind. This end-to-end solution gives you an operational chat app in as little as 15 minutes. Code for these templates is the azure-search-openai-demo featured in several presentations.

Instead of trying to define the meaning of the terms 'machine' and 'think', it is better to consider the question in a more practical way. We can set up an experiment which we call the 'Imitation Game'.\" (Turing, 1950)\n\nIn this game, a human evaluator interacts with both a human and a machine through a text interface. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell which participant is the machine, the machine is said to have passed the test.\n\n### Relevance to LLM Evaluation\nThe Turing Test has influenced modern benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs). These benchmarks often assess whether LLMs can generate human-like responses in conversation, similar to the original intent of Turing's test. The concept of indistinguishability between human and machine responses remains a foundational criterion in AI evaluations today.\n\n### Citations\n1. Turing, A. M.

Here are the key changes and updates between the two editions:\n\n1. **Scope and Focus**:\n - The **2020 guidance** primarily focused on the considerations for using AI and machine learning (ML) in the development of drugs and biological products. It emphasized the need for transparency and validation of AI models.\n - The **2022 guidance** expanded on this by providing a more structured framework for integrating AI into the drug development process. It introduced a risk-based approach, outlining specific steps for evaluating AI models' performance and their intended use in regulatory decision-making.\n\n2. **Framework for Evaluation**:\n - The **2020 version** suggested general principles for AI use but lacked a detailed framework for assessing AI models.\n - The **2022 guidance** introduced a **seven-step framework** for evaluating AI models, which includes defining the intended use, assessing the model's performance, and ensuring that the model is fit for its intended purpose. This structured approach aims to enhance the credibility and reliability of AI applications in drug development.\n\n3. **Engagement with the FDA**:\n - The **2020 guidance** encouraged early engagement with the FDA but did not specify how this should be conducted.\n - The **2022 guidance** explicitly encourages sponsors to engage with the FDA early in the development process to discuss their AI model development plans. This is intended to facilitate a clearer understanding of regulatory expectations and requirements.\n\n4. **Emphasis on Data Quality**:\n - The **2020 guidance** mentioned the importance of data quality but did not elaborate on how it impacts AI model performance.\n - The **2022 guidance** places a stronger emphasis on the quality of data used to train AI models, highlighting that poor data quality can lead to unreliable outcomes and regulatory challenges.\n\n5. **Regulatory Decision-Making**:\n - The **2020 guidance** provided a broad overview of how AI could support regulatory decisions.\n - The **2022 guidance** specifies that AI models should produce data that directly supports regulatory decisions regarding the safety, effectiveness, or quality of drugs and biological products.\n\n### Sources:\n- FDA Guidance on Artificial Intelligence in Drug Development (2020): [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/media/167973/download)\n- FDA Guidance on AI and ML in Drug Development (2022): [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/media/167973/download)\n- Overview of the FDA's AI Guidance Updates: [DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/insights/publications/2025/01/fda-releases-draft-guidance-on-use-of-ai)\n\nThese changes reflect the FDA's evolving understanding of AI's role in drug discovery and its commitment to ensuring that AI applications are safe, effective, and reliable.\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn23mXm7tvYW0TJR1HCWIiIbnkTwN", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n \"citation_resolvable\": \"no\",\n \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"yes\",\n \"overall_risk\": \"medium\",\n \"reasoning\": \"The assistant cites specific changes between the 2020 and 2022 FDA guidance but provides links that do not lead to distinct documents for each version, making the citations unresolvable.

A notable quote from the paper is:\n\n> \"The Transformer model is based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.\"\n\nThis highlights the core innovation of the transformer architecture, which relies on self-attention mechanisms to process input data without the need for recurrent or convolutional layers.\n\nFor more detailed theoretical insights, you may want to refer directly to the paper, as it discusses the architecture and its implications extensively.\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn23uPj6Mk2u6uVGnVCC3nblRGpSh", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n \"citation_resolvable\": \"yes\",\n \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"no\",\n \"overall_risk\": \"medium\",\n \"reasoning\": \"The citation is present and can be verified, but the assistant's claim about the absence of explicitly labeled theorems is subjective and may mislead readers regarding the paper's content.

Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Extracellular Vesicles and CD63**: A study highlighted the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers in cancer, specifically mentioning CD63. The research indicated that the presence of CD63 in plasma EVs could correlate with treatment responses in NSCLC patients undergoing immunotherapy, including pembrolizumab. This suggests that CD63 may serve as a predictive marker for therapeutic efficacy (source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360778213_Circulating_extracellular_vesicles_carrying_Firmicutes_reflective_of_the_local_immune_status_may_predict_clinical_response_to_pembrolizumab_in_urothelial_carcinoma_patients)).\n\n2. **Clinical Trials and Biomarkers**: In a clinical trial context, the dynamics of circulating EVs, including markers like CD63, were evaluated for their ability to predict responses to pembrolizumab. The study found that changes in EV profiles could provide insights into patient responses, indicating that CD63 might be a valuable marker in this setting (source: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12077285/)).\n\n3. **Prognostic Impact of EVs**: Another study focused on the prognostic impact of baseline circulating EVs, including CD63, in patients treated with pembrolizumab. The findings suggested that higher levels of CD63 could be associated with better treatment outcomes, reinforcing its potential as a predictive biomarker (source: [SciSpace](https://scispace.com/papers/prognostic-impact-of-baseline-circulating-extracellular-3udu807p)).\n\n4. **Comprehensive Review**: A review article discussed the role of various EV proteins, including CD63, in the context of NSCLC and immunotherapy. It emphasized the need for further research to validate these markers in clinical settings, particularly for predicting responses to pembrolizumab (source: [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1114041/full)).\n\nThese sources collectively indicate that CD63, as part of the EV proteomics landscape, holds promise as a predictive biomarker for responses to pembrolizumab in NSCLC, although further validation in clinical trials is necessary.\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn23yGjrQTHG5jZAqYcGGqq8EVrWb", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n \"citation_resolvable\": \"no\",\n \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"no\",\n \"overall_risk\": \"medium\",\n \"reasoning\": \"While the assistant provides citations, the sources are not independently verifiable as they are linked to external websites without specific details on the studies, making it impossible to confirm the claims made about CD63 and pembrolizumab.\"\n}", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765802038, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_aa07c96156", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 770, "total_tokens": 870, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 770, "completion_tokens": 100, "agent_id": null}
