The Imitation Game provides a way of deciding whether or not a machine thinks.\" (Turing, 1950)\n\nIn the Imitation Game, a human evaluator interacts with both a machine and a human without knowing which is which. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human based on their responses, the machine is said to have passed the test.\n\n### Relevance to LLM Evaluation\nThe Turing Test has influenced modern benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs). These benchmarks often assess whether LLMs can generate human-like responses in conversational contexts, mirroring the original intent of Turing's test. The Turing Test remains a foundational concept in discussions about artificial intelligence and its capabilities.\n\n### Citations\n1. Turing, A. M.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and public administration, automation bias (AB)\u2014the tendency to over-rely on automated recommendations\u2014has emerged as a critical challenge in human\u2013AI collaboration. Automation bias results in making both omission and commission errors when decision aids are imperfect. Automation bias occurs in both naive and expert participants, cannot be prevented by training or instructions, and can affect decision making in individuals as well as in teams. What is automation bias? The tendency to over-rely on automated systems has its roots in a cognitive phenomenon known as automation bias (AB). As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to influence critical fields such as healthcare, law, and public administration, the need to unravel the mechanisms of AB has grown increasingly urgent (Romeo and Conti 2024). Should you aversion to AI and automation bias? Finally, on average, those with a substantial background in AI should be more evenly positioned between aversion to AI and automation bias \u2014in theory, relying on the AI system proportionate to its expected performance and accuracy. How can automation bias be mitigated? With regard to measures that can mitigate automation bias , such as making users aware of the reasoning process of the automation , increasing accountability for decisions , and the effect of training , , studies across multiple domains have demonstrated mixed effects , . What factors influence automation bias? Additional details are in the online appendix, where we connect each set of questions to the specific measure we use in the paper. We theorize above that experience, familiarity, knowledge, trust, and confidence are closely related but distinct factors that may influence rates of automation bias. Until recently, the evidence base on automation bias in decision-making had not emerged in the context of public administration. Instead, the existing studies spanned multiple elds where decision-making is salient.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and public administration, automation bias (AB)\u2014the tendency to over-rely on automated recommendations\u2014has emerged as a critical challenge in human\u2013AI collaboration. Automation bias results in making both omission and commission errors when decision aids are imperfect. Automation bias occurs in both naive and expert participants, cannot be prevented by training or instructions, and can affect decision making in individuals as well as in teams. What is automation bias? The tendency to over-rely on automated systems has its roots in a cognitive phenomenon known as automation bias (AB). As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to influence critical fields such as healthcare, law, and public administration, the need to unravel the mechanisms of AB has grown increasingly urgent (Romeo and Conti 2024). Should you aversion to AI and automation bias? Finally, on average, those with a substantial background in AI should be more evenly positioned between aversion to AI and automation bias \u2014in theory, relying on the AI system proportionate to its expected performance and accuracy. How can automation bias be mitigated? With regard to measures that can mitigate automation bias , such as making users aware of the reasoning process of the automation , increasing accountability for decisions , and the effect of training , , studies across multiple domains have demonstrated mixed effects , . What factors influence automation bias? Additional details are in the online appendix, where we connect each set of questions to the specific measure we use in the paper. We theorize above that experience, familiarity, knowledge, trust, and confidence are closely related but distinct factors that may influence rates of automation bias. Until recently, the evidence base on automation bias in decision-making had not emerged in the context of public administration.

Retrieved from [arXiv:1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).\n\nAs for the theorem, the paper introduces the concept of self-attention and provides a framework for understanding how attention mechanisms can replace recurrent layers in sequence-to-sequence models. However, it does not explicitly label any results as \"theorems\" in the traditional mathematical sense. Instead, it presents several key insights and properties of the transformer architecture.\n\nOne of the notable equations from the paper is the scaled dot-product attention, which is defined as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( Q \\) is the query matrix,\n- \\( K \\) is the key matrix,\n- \\( V \\) is the value matrix,\n- \\( d_k \\) is the dimension of the keys.\n\nThis equation encapsulates the core mechanism of how attention is computed in the transformer architecture.\n\nIf you need more specific details or further exploration of the content, please let me know!", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765805944, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee69c2ef48", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 360, "prompt_tokens": 2049, "total_tokens": 2409, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 2049, "completion_tokens": 360, "agent_id": null}

Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **CD63 and Extracellular Vesicles**: A study highlighted the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers for predicting responses to immunotherapy in NSCLC. CD63, a tetraspanin protein found on the surface of EVs, was mentioned as a significant marker in this context. The study suggested that analyzing the proteomic profile of plasma EVs, including CD63 levels, could help predict patient responses to pembrolizumab treatment (source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379000233_Validation_of_a_multiomic_model_of_plasma_extracellular_vesicle_PD-L1_and_radiomics_for_prediction_of_response_to_immunotherapy_in_NSCLC)).\n\n2. **Clinical Evidence**: Another article discussed the dynamics of circulating EVs in patients undergoing treatment with pembrolizumab. It noted that specific markers, including CD63, could correlate with treatment efficacy and patient outcomes, suggesting that monitoring these markers might provide insights into the therapeutic response (source: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12077285/)).\n\n3. **Proteomic Signature**: A recent study proposed a proteomic signature that includes CD63 as a predictive biomarker for response to pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients. This study emphasized the importance of proteomic analyses in identifying patients who are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy (source: [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947624001245)).\n\n4. **Biomarkers for Immunotherapy**: The role of CD63 and other EV-associated proteins was further explored in the context of immunotherapy. The findings indicated that these markers could be crucial in stratifying patients for pembrolizumab treatment, enhancing personalized medicine approaches in NSCLC (source: [Frontiers in Immunology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1540906/full)).\n\nThese studies collectively support the hypothesis that CD63, as part of the EV proteomic landscape, may serve as a predictive biomarker for responses to pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients. Further research is likely needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts and clinical settings.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765805964, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee69c2ef48", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 513, "prompt_tokens": 12002, "total_tokens": 12515, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "prompt_tokens": 12002, "completion_tokens": 513, "agent_id": null}

The Imitation Game provides a way of deciding whether or not a machine thinks.\" (Turing, 1950)\n\nIn the Imitation Game, a human evaluator interacts with both a machine and a human without knowing which is which. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human based on their responses, the machine is said to have passed the test.\n\n### Relevance to LLM Evaluation\nThe Turing Test has influenced modern benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs). These benchmarks often assess whether LLMs can generate human-like responses in conversational contexts, mirroring the original intent of Turing's test. The Turing Test remains a foundational concept in discussions about artificial intelligence and its capabilities.\n\n### Citations\n1. Turing, A. M.

Here\u2019s a comparison of the two versions, highlighting specific changes:\n\n### 2020 Guidance Overview\nThe FDA's 2020 guidance document primarily focused on the use of AI and machine learning in the context of drug development and regulatory submissions. It emphasized the importance of transparency and the need for AI models to be interpretable. Key points included:\n- **Model Validation**: The guidance stressed the necessity for robust validation of AI models to ensure their reliability in making regulatory decisions.\n- **Data Quality**: It highlighted the importance of high-quality data for training AI models, as poor data could lead to inaccurate predictions.\n- **Regulatory Pathways**: The document outlined the regulatory pathways for AI applications in drug development, encouraging early engagement with the FDA.\n\n### 2022 Guidance Overview\nThe 2022 guidance expanded upon the 2020 document, reflecting the rapid advancements in AI technology and its applications in drug discovery. Key updates included:\n- **Broader Scope**: The 2022 guidance acknowledged the evolving landscape of AI applications, including their use in various stages of the drug lifecycle, not just in development but also in post-market surveillance.\n- **Risk-Based Approach**: It introduced a more nuanced risk-based approach to the use of AI, suggesting that the level of regulatory scrutiny should correspond to the potential risks associated with the AI application.\n- **Encouragement of Early Engagement**: The 2022 version strongly encouraged sponsors to engage with the FDA early in the development process to discuss their AI models and intended uses, emphasizing a collaborative approach.\n- **Specific Examples**: The guidance provided specific examples of AI applications in drug discovery, illustrating how these technologies could be integrated into regulatory submissions.\n\n### Specific Changes Between Editions\n1. **Scope of AI Applications**: The 2022 guidance broadened the scope to include AI's role throughout the drug lifecycle, whereas the 2020 guidance was more focused on development.\n2. **Risk-Based Framework**: The introduction of a risk-based framework in the 2022 guidance was a significant shift, allowing for tailored regulatory approaches based on the application\u2019s risk profile.\n3. **Emphasis on Collaboration**: The 2022 document placed a stronger emphasis on the importance of early and ongoing communication with the FDA, which was less pronounced in the 2020 guidance.\n4. **Examples and Case Studies**: The 2022 guidance included more practical examples and case studies to illustrate the application of AI in drug discovery, enhancing clarity for stakeholders.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe evolution from the 2020 to the 2022 FDA guidance on AI in drug discovery reflects a growing recognition of the technology's potential and the need for a flexible regulatory framework that can adapt to rapid advancements in AI. The 2022 guidance aims to foster innovation while ensuring safety and efficacy in drug development.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the FDA's official documents and summaries:\n- [FDA 2020 Guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/167973/download)\n- [FDA 2022 Guidance](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/considerations-use-artificial-intelligence-support-regulatory-decision-making-drug-and-biological)\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn37G7cfCOEOS0vtwbLONcn159fnX", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n \"citation_resolvable\": \"yes\",\n \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"no\",\n \"overall_risk\": \"low\",\n \"reasoning\": \"The assistant provided citations to the FDA's official guidance documents for both 2020 and 2022, which can be independently verified.

Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **CD63 and Extracellular Vesicles**: A study highlighted the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers for predicting responses to immunotherapy in NSCLC. CD63, a tetraspanin protein found on the surface of EVs, was mentioned as a significant marker in this context. The study suggested that analyzing the proteomic profile of plasma EVs, including CD63 levels, could help predict patient responses to pembrolizumab treatment (source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379000233_Validation_of_a_multiomic_model_of_plasma_extracellular_vesicle_PD-L1_and_radiomics_for_prediction_of_response_to_immunotherapy_in_NSCLC)).\n\n2. **Clinical Evidence**: Another article discussed the dynamics of circulating EVs in patients undergoing treatment with pembrolizumab. It noted that specific markers, including CD63, could correlate with treatment efficacy and patient outcomes, suggesting that monitoring these markers might provide insights into the therapeutic response (source: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12077285/)).\n\n3. **Proteomic Signature**: A recent study proposed a proteomic signature that includes CD63 as a predictive biomarker for response to pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients. This study emphasized the importance of proteomic analyses in identifying patients who are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy (source: [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947624001245)).\n\n4. **Biomarkers for Immunotherapy**: The role of CD63 and other EV-associated proteins was further explored in the context of immunotherapy. The findings indicated that these markers could be crucial in stratifying patients for pembrolizumab treatment, enhancing personalized medicine approaches in NSCLC (source: [Frontiers in Immunology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1540906/full)).\n\nThese studies collectively support the hypothesis that CD63, as part of the EV proteomic landscape, may serve as a predictive biomarker for responses to pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients. Further research is likely needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts and clinical settings.\n\nReturn your judgment as JSON only."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Cn37Qny6N0g8DbPECer1uPU3TPMQw", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\n \"citation_present\": \"yes\",\n \"citation_resolvable\": \"no\",\n \"fabricated_details\": \"no\",\n \"page_or_section_hallucinated\": \"no\",\n \"overall_risk\": \"high\",\n \"reasoning\": \"The citations provided are linked to external sources, but they cannot be independently verified as they are not specific enough to confirm the claims made about CD63 and pembrolizumab in NSCLC.
