Lazzizzera Re-assign community ArXiv (abs)PDFHTML Abstract Sep 11, 2025 · Abstract Penetration testing is critical for identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities, yet traditional approaches remain expensive, time-consuming, and dependent on expert human labor. Abstract Finite-time isothermal processes are ubiquitous in quantum-heat-engine cycles, yet complicated due to the coexistence of the changing Hamiltonian and the interaction with the thermal bath. Such complexity prevents classical thermodynamic measurements of a performed work. We argue that this rethinking needs support from an Abstract Relational Query Language (ARQL): a semantics-first reference metalanguage that separates query intent from user-facing syntax and makes underlying relational patterns explicit and comparable across user-facing languages. 2 days ago · Abstract page for arXiv paper 2512.12701: Efficient Vision-Language Reasoning via Adaptive Token Pruning Dec 10, 2025 · Abstract Stellar activity manifests differently across wavelengths, causing flux variability that can obscure planetary transits. While transit observations are typically performed in the visible and infrared bands, where stellar flux is relatively stable, short-wavelength regimes exhibit high variability, complicating reliable detections.

See full list on builtin.com Alan Turing is considered one of the pioneers of computer science and artificial intelligence.

See full list on builtin.com Although Alan Turing came up with an influential test while considering whether or not machines can think, Turing ’s test is not a sufficient indicator of artificial intelligence. Not only does Turing ’s test fail to account for whether or not a machine understands its input and output, it also accounts for neither a machine’s ability to recognize pa...

See full list on builtin.com Nov 16, 2023 · In Alan Turing ’s original paper, the majority of the text is a presentation of arguments against potential criticism of the test . In fact, he takes “such pains to point out the fallacies in contrary views.” [7] This tension that Alan Turing suggests is particularly carried forth at the face of LLMs. Sep 16, 2024 · The Turing Test is one of the most well-known and debated concepts in artificial intelligence (AI). It was proposed by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950 in his seminal paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence.\" He proposed that the \" Turing test is used to determine whether or not a computer (machine) can think intelligently like humans\"? The article aims ... May 14, 2025 · Is the Turing test still relevant in today\\'s AI landscape? The advent of large language models has challenged its importance. Should we use the Turing test as a benchmark? In summary, using the Turing test as a benchmark has its detractors who say it misguides AI research and ignores more meaningful measures of intelligence. Nonetheless, the fact that modern models are nearing this benchmark forces us to confront the ethics of AI indistinguishable from humans. Who invented the Turing test? It was proposed by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950 in his seminal paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence.\" He proposed that the \"Turing test is used to determine whether or not a computer (machine) can think intelligently like humans\"? Is the Turing test becoming obsolete? While the Turing test might be held as a benchmark for AI systems to surpass, Eleanor Watson, an expert in AI ethics and member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),told Live Science that \" The Turing Test is becoming increasingly obsolete as a meaningful benchmark for artificial intelligence (AI) capability.\" What is a Turing test? The Turing Test does not require the machine to be correct or logical in its responses but rather to be convincing in simulating human conversation. The test is fundamentally about deception —the machine must fool the judge into believing that it is human. The key criteria include the following for turing test: The Turing Test remains a guiding benchmark to measure progress toward this vision.

Turing’s responses to critics and propaganda for machine intelligence are highlighted.\\n---\\nTitle: The Turing Test - Duke University\\nURL: https://courses.cs.duke.edu/spring20/compsci342/netid/readings/Copeland2000_Article_TheTuringTest.pdf\\nSnippet: Turing’s ‘ Proposal for Development in the Mathematics Division of an Auto-matic Computing Engine (ACE)’ (Turing, 1945), which was written at the National Physical Laboratory, London, between October and December 1945, was the first relatively complete specification of an electronic stored-program general-purpose digital computer.\\n---\\nTitle: The Turing Test - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\nURL: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/?pubDate=20250315\\nSnippet: Mar 15, 2025 · The phrase “The Turing Test ” is most properly used to refer to a proposal made by Turing (1950) as a way of dealing with the question whether machines can think. According to Turing, the question whether machines can think is itself “too meaningless” to deserve discussion (442). However, if we consider the more precise—and somehow related—question whether a digital computer can do ...\\n---\\nTitle: The Turing Test: What It Proves and What It Doesn’t\\nURL: https://www.sciencenewstoday.org/the-turing-test-what-it-proves-and-what-it-doesnt\\nSnippet: Aug 23, 2025 · But as powerful as the Turing Test was, it also raised difficult questions: What exactly does it prove about intelligence, and what does it leave unanswered? To this day, the Turing Test remains both a landmark in artificial intelligence and a lightning rod for debates about the nature of mind.\\n---\\nTitle: Turing Test: 50 Years Later\\nURL: https://crl.ucsd.edu/~asaygin/papers/MMTT.pdf\\nSnippet: Turing (1950) is a very well-known work and has been cited and quoted copiously.

First proposed by the visionary British mathematician Alan Turing in a landmark 1950 paper, the test provides a practical (and pretty fun) way to determine if a computer has achieved human levels of intelligence. Turing called it \" the imitation game.\" If a computer — through a text-only chat — can convince a human that ...\\n---\\nTitle: The Turing Test (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\\nURL: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/\\nSnippet: Second, there is a discussion of current assessments of various proposals that have been called “ The Turing Test ” (whether or not there ...\\n---\\nTitle: What is the Turing Test? | Definition from TechTarget\\nURL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/Turing-test\\nSnippet: The original Turing Test requires three terminals, each of which is physically separated from the other two. ...

Jun 1, 2025 · Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and incorporating it into the LLM's generation process. This approach improves factual accuracy and enables dynamic knowledge updates, making LLMs particularly suitable for educational applications . Feb 13, 2025 · Enter retrieval augmented generation (RAG) —an innovative approach that seamlessly integrates information retrieval with text generation . This powerful combination of retrieval and generation has the potential to revolutionize applications from customer service chatbots to intelligent research assistants. What is retrieval augmented generation (Rag)? Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to retrieve and incorporate new information . With RAG, LLMs do not respond to user queries until they refer to a specified set of documents. These documents supplement information from the LLM's pre-existing training data. Why is retrieval-augmented generation important? However, LLMs still face several challenges, including hallucination and static internal knowledge, which hinder their reliability in educational settings. Retrieval - Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and incorporating it into the LLM's generation process. How can retrieval-based knowledge augmentation improve student learning? By integrating retrieval -based knowledge augmentation, RAG systems can provide students with explanations, adapt to curriculum changes, and mitigate the risks of misinformation. What is contextual retrieval Rag? Contextual Retrieval RAG uses conversation history or situational context to refine retrieval processes , ensuring that responses are coherent and relevant over multiple interactions. Context Awareness: Maintains a running memory of previous interactions or queries. Dynamic Query Refinement: Adapts retrieval strategies based on user context. This process flow helps developers update data sources without retraining the model and makes RAG a scalable and cost-effective solution for building LLM applications in domains like customer support, knowledge bases and internal search.
